# Barcode Readers
Uses:
- Airline Baggage Tracking
- Product Labelling
- Parcel Delivery and Shipment
- Ticketing and Identification

Barcode readers  work due to the fact light from a laser is absorbed more by black and reflected more by white, this means when shining at a pattern the sensor can detect the intensity of light that bounces back. A black bar will absorb more light and be less reflective giving a binary reading of 1 while a white bar will be more reflective with a binary reading of 0. The pattern of Os and Is creates a unique identity.

Two common types of barcode system:
- Universal Product Code version 'A' (UPC-A) / European Article Number (EAN), which is used in retail and warehousing.
- Code 128, which is used in transport and shipment tracking.

Code 128 can represent letters and numbers.

UPC-A and EAN can only represent numeric digits. It uses long guard bars to show the start and end of the barcode and also central guard bars to distinguish left from right. UPC-A/ EAN uses seven bar elements to form four alternating dark and light bars of varying thicknesses to represent each data item between the guard bars.
Visually, a grouping of two or more adjacent bars appear as a single wide bar. The codes on the right hand are the inverse of the codes on the left hand. Left hand codes all have an odd number of black bars. Right hand codes all have an even number.

# Digital Cameras
A camera works in much the same way as a scanner, when a digital camera captures an image it breaks up what it sees through its lens into a grid of pixels. The shutter opens to let light onto a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor at the back of the lens. The intensity of light is measured by millions of tiny sensors (one per pixel) arranged in a grid on the sensor, the light levels for each pixel are represented as binary values and this information is then stored as an image in the camera's memory. 

Red, Green or Blue filters are used with different sensors in the camera to separate out these wavelengths. The intensity of each of these colours falling on the sensors is measured and stored to create an RGB value.

# Laser Printers
Laser printers use dry powdered ink called toner, the toner is given a negative static charge. A laser shines a reverses image of the page at the drum which reverses the charge on the drum. The negatively charged toner sticks to the positively charged image. Toner is transferred from drum to the paper and fused using a heat roller.
