Primary storage is volatile and usually refers to RAM while secondary storage refers to non-volatile storage. Secondary storage consists of:
- Magnetic storage like the hard disk.
- Optical storage that uses laser light such as CD-ROM.
- Solid state devices using Flash memory.

# Tracks, sectors and platters
Concentric tracks are created on a magnetic disk which spins at high speeds (around 3,600 â€” 7,200rpm). Spinning platters are each read by drive heads, data is read or written as sector moves under the head. Magnetic storage devices use positive or negative polarisation of magnetic particles to create a binary pattern on the disk. Changes from negative to positive, or vice-versa creates electromagnetic pulses. Each pulse (or change) is read as a 1 no change is a 0. Fitting more data in the same physical space has required technological changes such as more densely packed platters and smaller magnetic parts and read/write heads. For CD's A high powered laser "burns" pits into the CD surface. Then a low-powered laser detects the reflection from pits and lands, only a pit end or start deflects the laser light to be read as a binary 1 by the light sensor.

# Disk latency
Latency is the time taken to read/write disk data, this includes:
- Seek Delay, the time the head takes to move across the disk.
- Rotational Delay, the time the disk takes to move to the correct sector underneath the read/write head.
- Transfer Time, time taken to move the actual data.

# Formats
Optical disks are available as:
- Read only
- Recordable
- Re-writable formats
Each format uses slightly different techniques to achieve a differential between a 'pit' and a 'land'. Recordable formats use a transparent dye that becomes opaque when heated by a laser, Re-writable formats use a laser to change the state of a phase-change alloy and a magnet to set the new state. Different laser wavelengths can 'burn' smaller pits, the spiral track can therefore be more tightly wound, creating a longer track.

# NAND Flash Memory
Flash memory contains no moving parts, floating gate transistors trap and store a charge which is retained even without power. A Solid State Disk comprises millions of NAND flash memory cells. The cells are also managed by a controller that organises pages and blocks of memory. These are arranged within an array of chips on a circuit board. The advantages of an SSD over a traditional Hard Disk are as follows:
- Faster access speed as there is no moving read/write head
- Lower power consumption
- Extended battery life in portable devices
- Devices stay cooler
- Less susceptible to damage
- Silent in operation
- Lighter in weight
