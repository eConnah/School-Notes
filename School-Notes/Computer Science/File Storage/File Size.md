# Sound
The sampling rate and the resolution allow us to determine the size of a file required to create a digital copy of the sound waves. Sampling rate indicates number of samples per second (Hertz) and resolution is number of bits used per sample.
- File Size = Sample Rate * Resolution * Song Length
This gives the file size in bits so to convert it to bytes divide by 8.
For stereo sound, two channels are recorded for left and right, doubling the file size.
