A bit is the smallest unit of digital information, representing a binary digit (0 or 1), a byte consists of 8 bits. To convert a binary number to decimal, each bit is assigned a positional value based on powers of 2. The 1st bit is $2^{0}$, 2nd bit $2^{1}$ and so on. In order to convert a number of bits to bytes, divide the number of bits by 8. Memory sizes in computers are often measured in bytes, this includes RAM, Storage and VRAM. Bytes and bits also have many prefixes including:
- 1 KiB = 1024 Bytes
- 1 Kib = 1024 Bits
- 1 KB = 1000 Bytes
- 1 kb = 1000 Bits
