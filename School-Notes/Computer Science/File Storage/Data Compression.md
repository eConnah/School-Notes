There are two different types of compression, lossy and lossless. Lossy compression removes non essential data is permanently removed for example different shades of the same colour in an image or frequencies of sound outside the range of human hearing. Lossless, uses patterns in the data that can be shortened without permanently removing any data.

# Run Length Encoding
A basic method of compression that summarises consecutive patterns of the same data, works well with image and sound data where data could be repeated many times. If there is no repetition it could have the opposite effect and increase file size.
