An imperative high-level language consists of commands for the computer to perform. This is in contrast to a declarative language which focuses on what the program should do without listing the steps needed to achieve the result. Database query languages such as SQL are declarative languages. While a high-level program has to be converted into machine code before it can be executed, they are much easier and faster to write, debug and maintain programs. High-level language programs are portable, a program written for one type of computer can be re-compiled for a different type of computer.
