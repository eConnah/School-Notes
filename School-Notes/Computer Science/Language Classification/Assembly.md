The next stage in the development of programming languages was assembly language, in assembly each opcode was replaced by a mnemonic which gave a clue as to what the operation did. The operand was replaced by a decimal (or hexadecimal) number. There is still a one-to-one correspondence between assembly language and machine code instructions. It is much easier to write, understand and debug programs in assembly language than [[Machine Code]] but the assembly code has to be translated into machine code by an assembler.
