Colossus Mark 1 was developed by Tommy Flowers and built at Bletchley Park in 1943. The input was a continuous loop of paper tape with 20,000 5-bit characters. It was programmed using switches and plug panels and the output was an indicator lamp panel. Alan Turing and his colleagues used the Colossus to break the Enigma Code made by the Germans in the Second World War. The code used a Vernam-type cipher and the key changed every day, the ciphertext was read in from the paper tape. The urgency of the situation led to Britain's best brains being recruited to develop both the hardware and the software to solve the problem. By the late 1940s there were still only a handful of computers around, used by large companies for commercial applications such as payroll. These early computers had limited memory, with each memory cell consisting of a vacuum tube the size of a light bulb. They had a control unit and an accumulator where instructions were carried out. They were programmed using machine code, entered using a series of switches.
