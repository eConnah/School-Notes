### Game Concept: **"EcoCity Builder"**

Players manage a city and its resources, balancing growth, sustainability, and citizen happiness. They interact with various systems like building infrastructure, trading resources, and optimizing resource allocation.

### Techniques Breakdown

#### **Model**

1. **Complex data model in the database**
    
    - Create tables for:
        - **Buildings** (type, resource generation, capacity, etc.)
        - **Citizens** (happiness, skill levels, assigned jobs)
        - **Resources** (types, quantities, production rates)
        - **Events** (random occurrences like natural disasters or economic booms).
2. **Structures like hash tables, graphs, trees**
    
    - **Graph**: Represent the city as a graph with roads as edges and buildings as nodes. Pathfinding algorithms can determine the shortest delivery routes for resources.
    - **Hash tables**: Store resource inventories for quick access (e.g., `{"Wood": 100, "Steel": 50}`).
3. **Files organised for direct access**
    
    - Save and load game states using binary files for performance.
    - Maintain separate files for high scores, achievements, and city layouts.
4. **Complex models and OOP**
    
    - Use **classes** to represent entities like `Building`, `Citizen`, and `Resource`.
    - Employ **inheritance** for different building types (`House`, `Factory`, `Hospital`).
    - Use **composition** for citizens working in buildings, and polymorphism for resource generation methods.
5. **Complex client-server model**
    
    - Implement a **multiplayer mode** where players trade resources with others or compete to have the most sustainable city.
    - Use the client-server architecture to handle game logic on the server while the client updates the UI.

#### **Algorithms**

1. **SQL Functions**
    
    - Use **aggregate SQL queries** to calculate total resources, average citizen happiness, or building efficiency.
    - Cross-table queries to link citizens’ productivity with building output.
2. **Graph/Tree Traversal**
    
    - Implement **BFS** or **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to calculate resource delivery routes between buildings.
3. **List operations**
    
    - Manage a list of events and process them in order of occurrence.
4. **Linked list maintenance**
    
    - Use linked lists to handle resource queues for production in factories.
5. **Stack/Queue operations**
    
    - Use stacks for undo actions (e.g., cancel the last construction).
    - Use queues for citizen job assignments.
6. **Hashing**
    
    - Hash player IDs or resource types for fast lookups.
7. **Recursive algorithms**
    
    - Recursive algorithms for determining the best placement of buildings in a limited area (backtracking).
8. **Merge sort**
    
    - Sort citizens by happiness or productivity efficiently.
9. **Dynamic generation of objects using OOP**
    
    - Dynamically create new citizens and buildings as the city grows.

### Gameplay Example:

1. **Start Game**  
    Players choose a map and begin with basic resources to build their first few structures.
    
2. **Expand City**  
    Players construct buildings, hire citizens, and manage resource production and consumption.
    
3. **Events & Challenges**  
    Random events force players to adapt (e.g., a flood destroys roads, requiring repairs using specific resources).
    
4. **Win Conditions**  
    Achieve sustainability (e.g., balancing resource input/output) or grow to a specific population size.
