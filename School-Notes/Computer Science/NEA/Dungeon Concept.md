### Game Concept: **"Dungeon Explorer"**

Players navigate through a procedurally generated dungeon filled with treasures, traps, and enemies. They make decisions about which paths to take, items to collect, and battles to fight, aiming to escape with the maximum treasure.

### Techniques Breakdown

#### **Model**

1. **Complex Data Model in the Database**
    
    - Tables for:
        - **Dungeons** (unique IDs, dimensions, difficulty levels).
        - **Rooms** (linked to dungeon ID, coordinates, type: trap, treasure, enemy, etc.).
        - **Items** (ID, name, attributes: damage, defense, healing).
        - **Enemies** (types, health, damage, AI behavior).
        - **Player Stats** (health, inventory, position).
2. **Structures like hash tables, graphs, trees**
    
    - **Graph**: Represent the dungeon as a graph where rooms are nodes and corridors are edges.
    - **Hash tables**: Store inventory items for fast access.
3. **Files Organised for Direct Access**
    
    - Save dungeon states and player progress using binary files.
    - Use separate files for randomly generated dungeon layouts.
4. **Complex Models and OOP**
    
    - Classes for `Dungeon`, `Room`, `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Item`.
    - Use inheritance to define specific enemy types (e.g., `Goblin`, `Dragon`) with unique behavior.
    - Use polymorphism for room interactions (e.g., enter a treasure room vs. a trap room).
5. **Complex Client-Server Model**
    
    - Add multiplayer support where players explore the dungeon together, cooperating or competing.
    - The server handles dungeon generation and synchronization between clients.

#### **Algorithms**

1. **SQL Functions**
    
    - Use **aggregate queries** to summarize player stats (e.g., total damage dealt, treasures collected).
    - Cross-table joins to link room contents to the dungeon layout.
2. **Graph/Tree Traversal**
    
    - Implement **DFS** or **BFS** for dungeon exploration.
    - Use pathfinding algorithms like A* for enemies to chase the player.
3. **List Operations**
    
    - Maintain lists of visible rooms and dynamically update as the player moves.
4. **Linked List Maintenance**
    
    - Use a linked list for managing turn-based actions in combat (player/enemy turns).
5. **Stack/Queue Operations**
    
    - Stack for undo actions, like retracing steps in the dungeon.
    - Queue for room generation in procedural generation.
6. **Hashing**
    
    - Hash item names or room IDs for quick lookups during interactions.
7. **Recursive Algorithms**
    
    - Recursively generate dungeons with interconnected rooms and guaranteed paths to the exit.
8. **Merge Sort**
    
    - Sort treasures based on value or enemies by difficulty.
9. **Dynamic Generation of Objects Using OOP**
    
    - Generate rooms, enemies, and treasures dynamically as the player explores.

### Gameplay Example

1. **Start Game**  
    Players begin at the dungeon entrance with basic gear and stats.
    
2. **Dungeon Exploration**  
    Players choose paths, encountering traps, treasures, or enemies.
    
    - Treasure rooms allow players to collect loot.
    - Trap rooms require solving puzzles or sacrificing resources to escape.
    - Combat rooms initiate battles.
3. **Leveling Up**  
    Players gain experience to improve stats and unlock abilities, making exploration easier.
    
4. **Escape or Lose**  
    The goal is to find the exit while collecting as much treasure as possible. Players lose if health reaches zero.
