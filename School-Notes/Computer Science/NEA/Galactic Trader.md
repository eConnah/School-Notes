### Game Concept: **"Galactic Trader"**

Players are space traders navigating a procedurally generated galaxy. They manage a fleet of ships, trade goods between planets, battle space pirates, and upgrade their ships to dominate the galactic economy.

### Techniques Breakdown

#### **Model**

1. **Complex Data Model in the Database**
    
    - Tables for:
        - **Planets** (ID, name, coordinates, available goods, prices, demand).
        - **Ships** (ID, type, cargo capacity, speed, health).
        - **Goods** (type, base price, rarity, weight).
        - **Fleets** (list of ships owned by a player).
        - **Players** (ID, credits, fleet, current location, reputation).
2. **Structures like hash tables, graphs, trees**
    
    - **Graph**: Represent the galaxy as a graph where planets are nodes and hyperspace routes are edges.
    - **Hash tables**: Quickly store and retrieve planet data or trade good stats.
3. **Files Organised for Direct Access**
    
    - Save galaxy layouts, player progress, and trade history in binary files.
    - Use logs for player transactions and trade routes.
4. **Complex Models and OOP**
    
    - Classes for `Planet`, `Ship`, `Good`, `Fleet`, and `Player`.
    - Use **inheritance** for different ship types (e.g., `Cargo Ship`, `Fighter`, `Explorer`).
    - Use **composition** to manage fleets containing multiple ships.
    - Implement **polymorphism** for ship abilities (e.g., faster travel or better combat stats).
5. **Complex Client-Server Model**
    
    - Multiplayer mode allows players to trade, form alliances, or battle each other.
    - The server handles galaxy state, player interactions, and persistent trade data.

#### **Algorithms**

1. **SQL Functions**
    
    - Use **aggregate SQL queries** to calculate the average price of goods across planets or the most profitable trade routes.
    - Cross-table queries to link player fleets with owned ships and their cargo.
2. **Graph/Tree Traversal**
    
    - Use **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** or **A*** for finding the shortest trade route between planets.
3. **List Operations**
    
    - Manage inventories of goods, ships, and trade logs using lists.
4. **Linked List Maintenance**
    
    - Implement linked lists for managing ongoing missions or queued upgrades for ships.
5. **Stack/Queue Operations**
    
    - Use queues for handling events like pirate attacks or planet trade market updates.
    - Use a stack for undoing recent fleet movements.
6. **Hashing**
    
    - Hash goods by type for quick price lookups on planets.
    - Hash player IDs for multiplayer interactions.
7. **Recursive Algorithms**
    
    - Recursive generation of galaxies with connected planets and trade routes.
    - Recursive exploration of pirate hideouts or abandoned space stations.
8. **Merge Sort**
    
    - Sort planets by proximity or goods by profitability.
9. **Dynamic Generation of Objects Using OOP**
    
    - Generate ships, trade goods, and random events dynamically based on player actions.

### Gameplay Example

1. **Start Game**  
    Players begin with a small ship and some credits on a random planet.
    
2. **Trading and Exploration**  
    Players buy goods at low prices, navigate to other planets, and sell for a profit.
    
    - Prices fluctuate based on supply, demand, and events (e.g., wars or famines).
3. **Combat and Missions**  
    Players encounter pirates or accept missions to deliver goods, rescue stranded ships, or explore uncharted space.
    
4. **Fleet Management and Upgrades**  
    Players use profits to buy better ships, upgrade their fleet, or invest in planet economies.
    
5. **Win Conditions**  
    Players can aim to:
    
    - Become the wealthiest trader.
    - Build the largest fleet.
    - Conquer pirate factions or establish trade monopolies.
