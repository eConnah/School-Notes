- Programs are more reliable and have fewer errors.
- They take less time to test and debug.
- They are easier to maintain.

Benefits of structured programming:
- Programs are more easily and quickly written.
- Large programs are broken down into subtasks that are easier to program and manage.
- Each module can be individually tested.
- Modules can be re-used several times in a program.
- Frequently used modules can be saved in a library and used by other programs.
- Several programmers can simultaneously work on different modules, shortening development time.
- Programs are more reliable and have fewer errors.
- It is easier to find errors in small self-contained modules.
- Programs take less time to test and debug.
- Programs are easier to maintain.
- A well-organised, modular program is easier to follow.
- It is easier to find which module needs to be changed.
- Self-contained modules mean that the change should not affect the rest of the program.
- New features can be added by adding new modules.
