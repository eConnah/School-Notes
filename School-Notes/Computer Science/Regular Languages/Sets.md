Sets formalise the idea of grouping objects together and viewing them as a single entity, in this way a set becomes an abstraction, there is a close relationship between set theory and logic, the laws governing sets form part of the governing group. A set is a well defined collection of objects, objects in the set are members or elements. A set is unordered and is denoted by a capital letter while members are usually lowercase letters. A set can be defined by listing every member enclosed by { }.

To say something is a member of a set you write $$x \in \mathbb{I} \wedge \text{is even}$$

# Notation
Union
$A \cup B$ is the set of all members that are in A or in B or in both.

Intersection
$A \cap B$ is the set of all members in both A and B.

Difference
$A \setminus B$ is the set of all members that are in A but not in B.

Subset
$A \subseteq B$
When every member of A is a member of B.

Not a Subset
$A \nsubseteq B$
When at least one member of A is not in B.

Proper Subset
$A \subset B$
When every member of A is a member of B but they aren't equal.

The cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) such that $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Cartesian product notation is read as $A \times B$.
$$A \times B = {a,b} | a \in A \wedge b \in B$$

The cardinality of a finite set is the number of elements in a set. The cardinality of a set $A$ is denoted by $|A|$ An infinite set contains an infinite number of distinct members. Both N and R are infinite sets A countably infinite set is one whose members can be counted using the infinite set N. Therefore, it is a countably infinite set The set R, is not countable.
