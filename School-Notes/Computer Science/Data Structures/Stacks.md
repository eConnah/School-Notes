In computer science, a stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. A stack is a linear data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end called the top of the stack. The basic operations on a stack include push, pop, and peek. Stacks are commonly used in various applications such as function call management, undo mechanisms, and expression evaluation.

Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The array implementation of a stack provides efficient memory usage, as the size of the stack is fixed. However, this can lead to stack overflow if the stack becomes full. On the other hand, the linked list implementation allows for dynamic memory allocation, but it may have higher memory overhead.

These methods could be written to implement the required functionality of a stack:
- push(item) — adds item to the top of the stack
- pop() — removes and returns the item on the top of the stack
- isFull() — checks if the stack is full
- isEmpty() — checks if the stack is empty
- peek() — return the top item without removing it
- size() — return the number of items on the stack

# The Call Stack
When a function is called, the processor pushes information about the function onto the call stack. This information includes the memory address of the function, the values of any variables defined within the function, and the return address, which is the memory address of the instruction following the function call.

When the function returns, the processor pops the information off the call stack and jumps to the return address. This allows the program to continue executing correctly after the function call.

The call stack is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure, which means that the last function called is at the top of the stack and the first function called is at the bottom. When a function is called, it is pushed onto the top of the stack, and when it returns, it is popped off the top of the stack.The call stack is an important part of a computer program's execution because it ensures that functions are called and returned in the correct order. If there is an error in a function call, such as a missing closing parenthesis or bracket, the call stack can help identify the location of the error.
