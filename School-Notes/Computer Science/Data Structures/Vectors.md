Uses of vectors:
- Graphics and 3D graphics - Images are defined as paths, not distinct bit patterns, rules of mathematics allow scaling without distortion.
- Computer games / simulations - The combination of moving forces, represented by vectors, can be resolved into a single path by using the same mathematical rules. For example, a ship steering against the wind and sea, calculating collision paths.
- Multiple dimensions - Can represent 2, 3, or more dimensions.

In order to translate from mathematical notation to a notation more useful in programming, we use a function map The notation 'S maps to $\mathbb{R}$' means a vector can be used as a location indicator, where S = {0, 1, 2, 3} maps to [2.55, -3.88, 4.11, 5.77]
