# Client Server Network
The server is a powerful computer which provides services or resources require by any of the clients. A client is a computer which request the serviced of resources provided by the server. The role of a client is to send a request to the server and wait for a reply. The role of the server is to wait for the client to send a request and then pass the request to another server from the wan.
The features of a client server network include:
- A central server is used to manage security.
- Some files are held on the central server.
- Some processing tasks are performed by the server.

There can often be many specialised servers especially in a large client-server network.
Each one will be dedicated to a certain task:
- Web Server
- Print Server
- Mail Server
- File Server
- Database Server

# Peer to Peer
A peer to peer network has no central server.
Features of a peer to peer network include:
- Suitable for a small company with few computers
- No central server controls files or security
- All computers can easily see files on other computers
- All computers can communicate with each other without going through a server.
- If a computer is switched off data cannot be retrieved.

The p2p configuration can also be used for file sharing websites. This means that with thousands of people downloading data can be passed between computers rather than just from the server. Peer-to-Peer networks are often used for the illegal distribution of copyright material such as music and films as they are very difficult to shut down.

The Cloud is an imaginary term for internet computing using remote servers run by organisations such as dropbox or microsoft. Instead of maintaining their own networks many organisations now run on cloud computing to share both software and files at different sites.
