A flip flop is an elemental sequential logic circuit that can store one bit and flip between two states, 0 and 1. A D-type flip flop has one input called D and a Clock signal input, as well as two outputs Q and NOT Q. The clock is another type of sequential circuit that changes state at regular time intervals, the clock is needed to synchronise the change of state of flip flop circuits. An edge-triggered D-type flip-flop only changes on the rising edge of the clock signal. That means that output Q only takes on a new value if the value at D has changed at the point of a clock pulse. This means that the clock pulse will freeze or 'store' the input value at D, in Q until the next clock pulse. D-type flip flops are used for creating registers and counters they can also be used for the intermediate storage needed during arithmetic operations. Static RAM is also created using D-type flip-flops, it's faster and more expensive than regular dynamic RAM since it doesn't need to be periodically refreshed. Static RAM is typically used for cache memory, while DRAM is used for main memory.
