Electronic devices can only recognise the presence or absence of a current, on or off. Switches can be combined in different ways to create simple circuits called logic gates. Electronic logic gates take one or more inputs and
produce a single output, this output can then become the input to the next gate. This can create a complex circuit.

# NOT Gate
- If 0 is the input it outputs 1
- If 1 is the Sinput it outputs 0

# AND Gate
- If both inputs are 1 then the output is 1
- Otherwise the output is 0

# OR Gate
- If either input is 1 then the output is 1
- Otherwise the output is 0

# XOR Gate
- If one, but not both, of the inputs is 1 then the output is 1
- Otherwise the output is 0

# NAND Gate
- This is an amalgamation or the AND and NOT gate
- It inverts the output of the AND gate

The NAND gate is useful as it combines the functions of two gates in a single gate. The NAND gate is known as a universal gate because different combinations of NAND gates can act like NOT, OR and AND gates In fact, any circuit can be built using just NAND gates. Using only NAND gates to build a circuit can minimise cost of production as well as possibly speed up processing.

# NOR Gate
- This gate inverts the OR gate
- The output is 1 only if both inputs are 0
