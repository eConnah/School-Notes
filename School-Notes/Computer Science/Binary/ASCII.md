ASCII is a character encoding standard that uses 7 bits to represent characters. It includes a set of 128 characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters. Extended ASCII exists which uses 8 bits instead of 7 to allow for more characters. ASCII only supports a limited set of characters, primarily used in the English language. ASCII is compatible with [[Unicode]], as the first 128 Unicode code points are the same as ASCII.
