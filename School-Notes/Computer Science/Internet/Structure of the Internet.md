The main part of the Internet is known as the backbone, this is a set of dedicated connections that connect several large networks at various points on the globe. Each of these points are then connected to other regional networks usually, controlled by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

# IP Addressing
## IPv4 
IPv4 addresses

## IPv6
IPv6 was needed due to growing demand of IP addresses.

A fully qualified domain name can be broken down into constituent parts including a host name and the domain name itself. URL's are used to specify the means of accessing a resources and its location across a network. The protocol and the domain name of the resource together form the URL.

# Domain Name System
DNS servers are dedicated computers with an index of domain names and their corresponding IP addresses. When a computer queries a DNS server for a domain name the server returns an IP address that the computer can use to send a message to it.
There are several DNS servers that work together to catalogue every web domain name. These are segmented into geographical groupings or levels. When the IP address of a given domain is not known a query is referred to a related domain server that could know.

Domain names must be unique otherwise DNS requests could be confused
Five global Internet Registries are responsible for allocating IP addresses to specific domain names
These Registries work together to maintain a database of address assignments that ensure that IP addresses and domain names are unique
