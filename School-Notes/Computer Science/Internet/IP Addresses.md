## Unusable addresses
Some IP addresses cannot be used as they are reserved for other purposes:
Address ranges 10.x.y.z, 172.16.0.1 to 172.31.255.255 and 192.168.y.z are private, non-routable addresses used for LANs or private WANS only
• x.y.z. represents an entire network
The last address in a network (e.g. x.y.z.255) is reserved as the broadcast address on that network for sending data simultaneously to all hosts on that network
• 127.x.y.z is reserved for loopback, in which a host's IP software treats an outgoing packet as incoming
