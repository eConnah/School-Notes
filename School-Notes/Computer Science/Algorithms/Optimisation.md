The algorithm is designed to find the shortest path between a start node and every other node in a weighted graph. The implementation of the algorithm is similar to a breadth first search, it uses a priority queue as the supporting data structure to keep a record of which vertex to visit next. To start, it assigns a temporary distance value to each node which is 0 at the start node, and $\infty$ at every other node.
