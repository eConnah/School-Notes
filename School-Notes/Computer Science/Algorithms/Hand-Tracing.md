Hand-tracing is useful for:
- Figuring out how an algorithm works
- Finding out why an algorithm is not working properly
A trace table is used to write down the contents of each variable as it changes during execution. If the program contains a loop, a helpful technique is to put the loop condition as the first column in the trace table, even if other variables have been defined before it.
