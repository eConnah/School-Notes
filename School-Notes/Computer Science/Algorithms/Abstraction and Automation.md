# Abstraction
Abstraction is an important tool in problem-solving. Information hiding is one aspect of abstraction that is very useful in all kinds of simulation problems in which the real world is modelled. All the details that do not contribute to the essential characteristics of the problem are omitted.
Some examples include:
- London Underground Map
- Loading Screens

## Data Abstraction
When a user can just use a method without knowing how internal details work. Like a user using a bank interface does not need to know how the system works behind the scenes.

## Problem Abstraction
This involves removing details until the problem reduces to one which has already been solved.

## Procedural Abstraction
Procedural abstraction is when a user can user a method such as turn on light, they don't need to know how it works and it doesn't return any values.

## Programming Abstraction
Abstraction is a key feature of programming languages such as Python, Java and Visual Basic. Using abstraction, the algorithms used to solve a problem are far removed from the actual machine code instructions that have to be carried out. Essentially we don't need to know how to write in binary to code.

## Functional abstraction
When you call a function to calculate a square root, or generate a random number this is also abstraction. Using a function does not require you to know anything about how the computation is carried out. You simply have to know how to call the function and what parameters to pass.

# Automation
Automation refers to building models of real world objects or phenomena in order to solve a particular problem. Computer scientists have to decide what details are relevant to the problem and discard everything else. Algorithms and data structures are then be designed to solve the problem allowing them to be implemented in code and executed.
