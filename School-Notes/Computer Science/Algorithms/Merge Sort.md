This is much more efficient than [[Bubble Sort]]. The basic steps are:
- Divide the unsorted list into $n$ sublists, each containing one element.
- Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

The [[Big-O Notation]] for Merge Sort is O($\log_{2} n$).
