It is not a "machine" in the sense of some physical, mechanical thing with moving parts. It is an abstract representation of how something changes from one state to another in response to a condition or event. For example opening a door changes its state from closed to open. The machine can only be in one state at a time, it can change from one state to another in response to an event or condition; this is called a transition.

# Finite State Automaton
A FSM which has no output is known as a finite state automaton. It has a start state and a set of end or accept states. If the automaton can reach a final state, it is said to accept the input.
The symbols for a finite state machine are as follows:
- Circle: A state
- Circle (input arrow cut off): Start State
- Circle (inside a circle): End State
- Transition: Curved arrow
