Sorting is a very common operation in data processing. There are many different sorting algorithms, from very simple ones which execute very slowly, (e.g. a [[Bubble Sort]]) to more complex ones which execute very fast (e.g. merge sort). On a given computer, a fast sort algorithm may sort ten million numbers in say 20 minutes, whereas an inefficient algorithm may take more than a month to sort the same data.
