Composition and aggregation are both "has a" relationships:
- an object contains another object.

Composition:
- If the containing object is destroyed so are the objects it contains.
- Depicted as a filled diamond and a solid line.

Aggregation:
- The object remains when the container object is destroyed.
- Depicted as an unfilled diamond on a solid line.
