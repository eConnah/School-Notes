A method used in a class hierarchy can behave differently in each class, this is achieved through overriding. A method with the same identifier in the superclass can be redefined or extended in the subclass.

Abstract methods are used to force subclasses to override a method.
Virtual methods are used to allow (but not force) a subclass to override.
Static methods are not unique to instances but shared across all.
