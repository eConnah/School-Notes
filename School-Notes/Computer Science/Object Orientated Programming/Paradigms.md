A programming paradigm is a style of programming, different types of problems need to be tackled in different ways such as:
- Calculating the forces that a new bridge need to withstand.
- Finding your way out of a maze.
- Translating from French to English.
- Finding all the cars in the DVLA database with a number plate beginning with AUH.

# Functional Paradigm
A functional program describes a series of functions. Each function takes in some data as arguments and returns an output. Functional programming has a lot in common with mathematics.

# Languages


# Composite Functions
Functional languages like Haskell use types such as:
- Integer and Int
- Float
- Bool
- Char
However in Haskell type declarations are not required and are simply optional.
