A class defines the characteristics of an object much like a blueprint.
Characteristics include:
Attributes - fields or properties
Behaviours - methods or operations

The main pillars of OOP are:
- A - Abstraction
- P - Polymorphism
- I - Inheritance
- E - Encapsulation

# Objects
An object is an instance of a class. Creating an object is also known as instantiation.

# Methods
A method is a behaviour of an object. Within a program a method usually only affects on object. All cars can accelerate but the program will only make the object the method is attached to accelerate. Defining the method in a class lets objects use it for themselves.

Method calling is the process that sends data to another object or asks the object to invoke a method.
