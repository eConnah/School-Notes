Procedural Programming consists of:
- Step by step instructions
- Calls to subroutines
- Local and global variables

Object Orientated Programming treats the world as a collection of objects such as:
- A person
- An animal
- An event
- A data structure

The programs of OOP consist of:
- Each object has its own data (attributes)
- And operations on that data (methods)
- Objects interact with one another
- All processing is done by objects

The classes of OOP consist of:
- A blueprint for an object
- Defines attributes and methods to capture characteristics of objects
- A constructor method allows us to make different versions of the same class

Encapsulation is a fundamental principle:
- Attributes and methods are wrapped into a single entity

Abstraction is hiding unnecessary details:
- An objects attributes are hidden (private)
- It's attributes are accessed and changed only through methods
- Methods are required to set (setters) and retrieve (getters) an objects attributes
- To interact with an object its methods must be accessible (public)
