- Inheritance is creating a new class based on an existing class (superclass).
- The new class is a subclass of the superclass.
- The subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass and has some of its own attributes and/or methods.

e.g.
Animal - Superclass
Fish - Subclass of animal
Duck - Subclass of animal

To create a subclass you declare it as:

```csharp
class Fish : Animal
{
	
}
```
