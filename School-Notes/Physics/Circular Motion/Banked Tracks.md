## Basics
Circular motion occurs when an object moves along a curved path with a constant speed but a continuously changing direction. Centripetal force is the inward force that acts on a body to keep it moving in a circular path. It's always directed towards the centre of the circle.
Formula: $$F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
Where:
- $m$ is the mass of the object.
- $v$ is the velocity.
- $r$ is the radius of the circular path.

Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration that occurs in circular motion, directed towards the centre of the circle.
Formula: $$a_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

## Banked Tracks:
A banked track is an inclined surface on which vehicles (such as cars or bikes) move in circular motion. Banking helps objects make turns at higher speeds by reducing the reliance on friction for centripetal force.

### Key Concepts:
Angle of banking ($\theta$): The angle at which the road or track is inclined to the horizontal.
Forces acting on an object on a banked track:
  1. The weight of the object ($mg$) acting vertically downwards.
  2. The normal reaction force ($N$) from the surface, acting perpendicular to the track.
  3. Friction (if any) between the tires and the road surface.
  
The components of these forces provide the necessary centripetal force to keep the object moving in a circular path.

### No Friction Banking:
In an ideal situation with no friction, the centripetal force is provided purely by the horizontal component of the normal force.

The vertical component of the normal force balances the object's weight: $$N \cos(\theta) = mg$$
  
The horizontal component provides the centripetal force: $$N \sin(\theta) = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
  
Dividing the second equation by the first eliminates $N$: $$\tan(\theta) = \frac{v^2}{rg}$$

Where:
- $v$ = velocity of the object
- $r$ = radius of the circular path
- $g$ = acceleration due to gravity
  
The banking angle ($\theta$) can be calculated based on the desired speed and radius of the turn. A steeper banking angle allows higher speeds without reliance on friction.
