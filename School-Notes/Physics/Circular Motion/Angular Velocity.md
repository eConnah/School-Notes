$$\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}$$
$$\theta = \frac{2 \pi t}{T}$$
$$\omega = 2 \pi f$$
$$a = r \omega^{2}$$
The centripetal force acts inwards on the circle and is the resultant force on an object. When $R=0N$ (during a jump) $v = \sqrt{gr}$. When an object is upside down in a circle the reaction force as well as weight are both pushing down $\therefore F=W+R$
