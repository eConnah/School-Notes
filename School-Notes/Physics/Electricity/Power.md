Power is a fundamental concept that describes the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. In the context of mechanics, power (P) is defined as the work done (W) per unit time (t). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
$$P = E_{w}t^{-1}$$
Where:
- P is power (in watts, W),
- W is work done (in joules, J),
- t is time (in seconds, s).

This formula highlights that power is the energy transferred or work done per unit time. In the International System of Units (SI), power is measured in watts, where one watt is equivalent to one joule per second.

Another important relationship involving power, work, and force (F) is given by:
$$P = Fv$$
Where:
- F is the force applied (in newtons, N),
- v is the velocity of the object (in metres per second, $ms^{-1}$).

The electrical power in a circuit can be determined using the formula:
$$P = IV$$
Where:
- I is the current flowing through the circuit (in amperes, A),
- V is the voltage across the circuit (in volts, V).
