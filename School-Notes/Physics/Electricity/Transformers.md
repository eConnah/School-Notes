Transformers are devices used to change the voltage of an alternating current (AC) supply. They are essential in the transmission and distribution of electrical energy, as they allow voltage to be increased (stepped up) or decreased (stepped down) efficiently. Transformers work on the principle of electromagnetic induction.

## Structure
A transformer consists of three main components:
- Primary Coil: The input coil connected to the AC supply.
- Secondary Coil: The output coil where the transformed voltage is obtained.
- Iron Core: A laminated iron core that links the magnetic flux between the primary and secondary coils.

The primary and secondary coils are wound around the iron core, but they are not electrically connected. The iron core ensures that almost all the magnetic flux generated by the primary coil passes through the secondary coil.

## How They Work
When an alternating current flows through the primary coil, it produces a changing magnetic field in the iron core. This changing magnetic field induces an alternating voltage in the secondary coil due to electromagnetic induction (Faraday's Law). The magnitude of the induced voltage depends on the number of turns in the primary and secondary coils.

Transformer Equations:
The relationship between the voltages and the number of turns in the coils is given by:
$$\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}$$
Where:
- $V_p$ = voltage across the primary coil (input voltage),
- $V_s$ = voltage across the secondary coil (output voltage),
- $N_p$ = number of turns in the primary coil,
- $N_s$ = number of turns in the secondary coil.

If $N_s > N_p$, the transformer is a step-up transformer (increases voltage).  
If $N_s < N_p$, the transformer is a step-down transformer (decreases voltage).

## Power and Efficiency
In an ideal transformer (100% efficient), the power input to the primary coil equals the power output from the secondary coil:
$$P_p = P_s$$
$$V_p \cdot I_p = V_s \cdot I_s$$
Where:
- $I_p$ = current in the primary coil,
- $I_s$ = current in the secondary coil.

From this, the relationship between currents and turns is:
$$\frac{I_p}{I_s} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}$$

In real transformers, efficiency is less than 100% due to energy losses.

## Energy Losses
- Resistance of the Coils: Energy is lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire in the coils ($I^2R$ losses).
- Eddy Currents: Induced currents in the iron core cause heating. Laminating the core reduces this effect.
- Hysteresis Losses: Energy is lost as the magnetic domains in the iron core realign with the changing magnetic field.
- Flux Leakage: Not all magnetic flux links the primary and secondary coils, reducing efficiency.

## Applications
- Power Transmission: Step-up transformers increase voltage for efficient long-distance transmission, reducing energy loss as heat in the cables. Step-down transformers reduce voltage for safe use in homes and industries.
- Electronics: Transformers are used in power adapters to convert mains voltage to lower voltages for electronic devices.
- Isolation: Transformers provide electrical isolation between circuits for safety.
