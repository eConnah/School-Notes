Ohm's Law states that [[Potential Difference]] (V) and [[Current]] (I) are directly proportional in a circuit with [[Resistance]] (R) being a constant (usually):
$$V = IR$$
Where:
- V is the potential difference (in volts, V)
- I is the current flowing through the circuit (in amperes, A)
- R is the resistance of the circuit (in ohms, $\Omega$)
