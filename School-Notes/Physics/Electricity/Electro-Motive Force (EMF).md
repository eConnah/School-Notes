While both [[Electro-Motive Force (EMF)]] and [[Potential Difference]] are measured in volts (V) and are related to energy, they represent different aspects of electrical circuits.

EMF ($\varepsilon$), often denoted by the symbol "$\varepsilon$" or "E", refers specifically to the electrical potential difference created by an energy source within a closed circuit. It represents the work done per unit charge (q) as it moves through the source:
$$\varepsilon = E_{w} / q$$
This work done essentially provides the "push" for the charged particles, typically electrons, to move around the circuit. Common examples of EMF sources include batteries and generators, where chemical reactions (batteries) or motional induction (generators) create the potential difference.

EMF is the root cause of the potential difference throughout the circuit, acting like a "pump" that creates the overall voltage. However, the actual PD experienced across different components within the circuit can vary depending on the resistance and other factors, unlike the constant EMF provided by the source.

The potential difference (PD), which is the actual voltage you measure across the cell's terminals, is always slightly less than the EMF. The larger the internal resistance, the bigger the "leak" or "lost volts" and the greater the difference between EMF and PD. Shown here by the equation:
$$\varepsilon = V + Ir$$
or
$$\varepsilon = I(R + r)$$
Where:
- $\varepsilon$ is the EMF.
- V is the terminal PD.
- r the internal resistance.
- R is the external resistance.
