In order for electrical current to flow there must be a complete circuit and a source of potential difference. This means that something is moving around the circuit, we call these charge carriers (in metals these are electrons). The size of current is measured in Amperes using an ammeter. The faster the electrons move in the circuit the larger the current is.  An amp is one coulomb of charge per second, where each coulomb contains $\textcolor{skyblue}{6.25 \times 10^{18}}$ electrons.

Electric current is the rate of flow of electric charge carriers such as electrons through a material. It is measured in amperes (A) and follows the relationship:
$$I=Qt^{-1}$$
Where:
- I is the current in amps
- Q is the charge in coulombs (C) that flows
- t is the time in seconds

The direction of conventional current is taken as the direction positive charges would flow, even though negatively charged electrons are the charge carriers in metals. 

Several factors determine the size of the current in a material, including the [[Potential Difference]] applied, the material's resistance, and how readily it allows charges to flow. Materials like metals contain free electrons that can move through the lattice when an electric field is applied, leading to high conductivity. Insulators have tightly bound electrons preventing free flow of charges. Semiconductors lie between conductors and insulators in conductivity.

![[Ohm's Law]]

Materials that obey [[Ohm's Law]] are called ohmic. Non-ohmic materials have a nonlinear current-voltage relationship.

The mechanism of electric current involves charges being accelerated by the electric field along the conductor, which causes collisions with the fixed lattice ions. This scatters the flowing charges and produces thermal energy. Superconductors can conduct electricity without resistance or energy loss below a transition temperature.
