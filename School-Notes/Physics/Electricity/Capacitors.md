A capacitor consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material known as a dielectric. When the capacitor is connected to a power source current flows. Electrons are driven from the negative terminal of the power source onto one of the plates, making it negatively charged. Simultaneously, electrons are pulled away from the other plate, leaving it positively charged. This separation of charge creates an electric field between the plates.

Initially, the current is high as there is no opposition to the flow of electrons. However, as electrons accumulate on the negative plate, they repel incoming electrons due to their like charges. This repulsion makes it progressively harder for additional electrons to join the negative plate. Similarly, as electrons are removed from the positive plate, it becomes increasingly difficult to remove more because the positive charge attracts electrons back. This resistance to charge movement slows the flow of electrons lowering the current.

As the capacitor charges, the potential difference (voltage) across its plates increases. The voltage is directly proportional to the amount of charge stored, as described by the equation: $$V = \frac{Q}{C}$$
Where:
- V is the potential difference, $(V)$
- Q is the charge, $(C)$
- C is the capacitance, $(F)$ 

The unity of capacitance is 1 farad and is equal to:
$$\mathrm{C=\frac{Q}{V}}$$

The potential difference starts at zero and gradually rises, approaching the voltage of the power source. When the capacitor is fully charged, the potential difference across it equals the supply voltage, and the electric field between the plates reaches its maximum strength.

The current in the circuit also changes significantly during the charging process. At the moment the capacitor is connected to the power source, the current is at its maximum because there is no initial opposition from the capacitor. However, as charge builds up and the potential difference increases, the capacitor increasingly resists the flow of electrons. This resistance causes the current to decrease over time. The relationship between current and time in an RC circuit is exponential, described by:
$$I = I_0 e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}$$
Where:
- $I_0$ is the initial current, $(A)$
- $R$ is the resistance, $(\Omega)$
- $C$ is the capacitance, $(F)$
- $t$ is time, $(s)$
Eventually, the current approaches zero as the capacitor becomes fully charged.
