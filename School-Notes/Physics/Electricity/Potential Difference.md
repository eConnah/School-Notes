Potential difference, also known as voltage (V), is the energy required to move a unit of charge between two points in an electric field. Mathematically, potential difference is expressed as the work done per unit charge (Q):
$$V = E_{w}Q^{-1}$$
Where:
- V is the potential difference (in volts, V),
- W is the work done (in joules, J),
- Q is the charge (in coulombs, C).

Moreover, in the context of a uniform electric field (E), the potential difference across a distance (d) can be expressed as:
$$V = Ed$$
Where:
- E is the electric field strength (in volts per meter, $Vm^{-1}$),
- d is the separation distance.
