![[Ohm's Law]]

The resistance of a conductor is influenced by various factors, including its length (L), cross-sectional area (A), and resistivity ($\rho$). The formula for resistance in terms of these parameters is given by:
$$R = \rho LA^{-1}$$
Where:
- $\rho$ represents the resistivity of the material (in $\Omega m$)
- L is the length of the conductor
- A is the cross-sectional area. 

This expression underscores the direct proportionality between resistance and length, as well as the inverse proportionality between resistance and the cross-sectional area.

Moreover, for resistors connected in series, the total resistance ($R_{\text{total}}$) is the sum of individual resistances:
$$R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + \ldots$$
In contrast, for resistors connected in parallel, the reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of individual resistances:
$$\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \ldots$$
