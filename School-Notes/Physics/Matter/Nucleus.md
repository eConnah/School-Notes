All the atom’s positive charge is contained in the nucleus. Almost all of the atom’s mass is concentrated in the nucleus. The size of the nucleus is about 1/10,000 the size of the atom.

J.J. Thompson discovered the electron and created the plum pudding model.

$$E_{k} = \frac{Q_{\alpha} Q_{\mathrm{N}}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}d}$$
$$d = \frac{Q_{\alpha} Q_{\mathrm{N}}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}E_{k}}$$
The electron diffraction method is more accurate than the electromagnetic equation because leptons aren’t affected by the strong force, which repels at close distances.
$$\sin \theta = \frac{1.22 \lambda}{2R}$$
