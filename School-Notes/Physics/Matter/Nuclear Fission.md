The output of a star is due to nuclear fusion reactions in the core, in main sequence stars this is due to hydrogen being fused into helium.

$$^{235}_{92}U+^{1}_{0}n \rightarrow ^{140}_{55}Cs+^{94}_{37}Rb+^{1}_{0}n+^{1}_{0}n$$
$$^{235}_{92}U+^{1}_{0}n \rightarrow ^{144}_{56}Ba+^{90}_{36}Kr+^{1}_{0}n+^{1}_{0}n$$
In fission, both fragments repel each other with sufficient force to overcome the SNF. There is a release of kinetic energy (mass is lost). The two fragments are smaller and more tightly bound than the original - have a higher binding energy - they are more stable. The kinetic energy released is equal to the change in binding energy.

## Fission Reactors

Nuclear fission reactors are devices that harness the energy released during nuclear fission to generate electricity. They are a key component of nuclear power plants and provide a significant portion of the world's electricity.

### **How Nuclear Fission Works**
Nuclear fission is the process in which a heavy nucleus, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two smaller nuclei (called fission fragments) when it absorbs a neutron. This process releases a large amount of energy, along with several neutrons. For example, when uranium-235 absorbs a neutron, it can split into barium-141 and krypton-92, releasing three neutrons and energy. The energy released is primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and neutrons, which is then converted into thermal energy.

### **Components of a Nuclear Reactor**
A nuclear reactor consists of several key components that work together to control the fission process and convert nuclear energy into electricity. The **fuel rods** contain fissile material, such as uranium-235, where the fission process occurs. The **moderator**, often made of water, heavy water, or graphite, slows down the fast neutrons produced during fission to thermal energies, making them more likely to cause further fission. **Control rods**, made of neutron-absorbing materials like boron or cadmium, regulate the rate of fission by adjusting the number of neutrons available to sustain the chain reaction. The **coolant**, usually water or liquid sodium, transfers heat from the reactor core to a heat exchanger, where it produces steam. The **pressure vessel** contains the reactor core and withstands high pressures and temperatures. The **heat exchanger** transfers heat from the coolant to water, producing steam that drives a turbine. Finally, the **turbine and generator** convert the steam’s thermal energy into mechanical energy and then into electrical energy.

### **The Chain Reaction**
A chain reaction occurs when the neutrons released from one fission event trigger further fission events in nearby nuclei. For a sustained chain reaction, at least one neutron from each fission event must cause another fission event, a state known as **criticality**. The rate of the chain reaction is controlled by adjusting the position of the control rods. Inserting the control rods absorbs more neutrons, slowing down the reaction, while withdrawing them absorbs fewer neutrons, speeding up the reaction. The reactor is designed to operate in a **critical state**, where the number of neutrons produced equals the number lost, ensuring a steady power output.

### **Energy Conversion Process**
The energy conversion process in a nuclear reactor involves several steps. First, nuclear energy from fission is converted into thermal energy in the reactor core. The coolant then transfers this thermal energy to a heat exchanger, where it heats water to produce steam. The steam drives a turbine, converting thermal energy into mechanical energy. Finally, the turbine drives a generator, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.

### **Safety Features**
Nuclear reactors are equipped with multiple safety features to prevent accidents and protect the environment. The **containment structure**, a thick concrete and steel shell, surrounds the reactor to prevent the release of radioactive materials in case of an accident. **Emergency cooling systems** provide cooling to the reactor core if the normal cooling system fails. Additionally, **redundant control systems** ensure the reactor can be shut down safely in an emergency.

### **Advantages of Nuclear Fission Reactors**
Nuclear fission reactors have several advantages. They have a **high energy density**, meaning a small amount of fuel produces a large amount of energy. They also produce **low greenhouse gas emissions** during operation, making them a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels. Furthermore, nuclear reactors provide a **reliable power supply**, as they can operate continuously for long periods without interruption.

### **Disadvantages of Nuclear Fission Reactors**
Despite their advantages, nuclear reactors also have some drawbacks. One major issue is the production of **radioactive waste**, which remains hazardous for thousands of years and requires safe storage. There is also a **risk of accidents**, as seen in events like Chernobyl and Fukushima, which can have severe consequences for human health and the environment. Additionally, building a nuclear power plant involves **high initial costs** and can be time-consuming.

### **Key Equations**
The energy released during fission can be calculated using Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence equation:
$$
E = \Delta m \cdot c^2
$$
where $\Delta m$ is the mass defect (the difference in mass before and after fission), and $c$ is the speed of light ($3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$). The power output of a reactor is given by:
$$
P = \frac{E}{t}
$$
where $E$ is the energy released and $t$ is the time.
