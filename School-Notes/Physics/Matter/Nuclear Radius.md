Nuclear Radius
Definition: The approximate radius of a nucleus, which increases with the number of nucleons (protons + neutrons).  
Key Formula:
  $$
  R = r_0 A^{1/3}
  $$
  $R$: Nuclear radius (m)  
  $r_0$: Empirical constant ≈ $1.2 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$ (1.2 fm)  
  $A$: Mass number (number of nucleons).  

Determining Nuclear Radius:  
  Electron Diffraction:  
     High-energy electrons are fired at nuclei.  
     The diffraction pattern is analysed to find the radius using the first minimum of the pattern.  
     Short wavelength of electrons ensures accurate measurements.  
  Rutherford Scattering:  
     Estimates the distance of closest approach of alpha particles to the nucleus.  
     Less precise than electron diffraction.  

Example Calculation:  
  Calculate the radius of a uranium-238 nucleus ($A = 238$):  
  $$
  R = 1.2 \times 10^{-15} \times 238^{1/3} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-15} \times 6.2 = 7.4 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \, (7.4 \, \text{fm}).
  $$

2. Nuclear Density  
Key Insight:  
  Nuclear density is constant for all nuclei, regardless of $A$.  
  Reason: Volume ($\propto R^3 \propto A$) and mass ($\propto A$) both scale with $A$, so $\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}$ remains constant.  

Formula Derivation:  
  Mass of nucleus: $\text{Mass} \approx A \times m_p$  
     ($m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$, mass of a nucleon).  
  Volume of nucleus:  
     $$
     V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (r_0 A^{1/3})^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 A
     $$  
  Density:  
     $$
     \rho = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{A m_p}{\frac{4}{3} \pi r_0^3 A} = \frac{3 m_p}{4 \pi r_0^3}
     $$  

Calculation:  
  $$
  \rho = \frac{3 \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27}}{4 \pi (1.2 \times 10^{-15})^3} \approx 2.3 \times 10^{17} \, \text{kg/m}^3
  $$  
  Comparison:  
    Nuclear density ≈ $ 10^{17} \, \text{kg/m}^3 $.  
    Extremely high compared to everyday materials (e.g., water: $ 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 $).

1. Key Points  
Nuclear radius grows slowly with $ A $ (proportional to $ A^{1/3} $).  
Nuclear density is constant due to mass and volume both scaling with $ A $.  
Significance:  
  Explains why atoms are mostly empty space (nucleus is tiny but extremely dense).

2. Typical Exam Questions  
Calculate the radius of a carbon-12 nucleus.  
   $$
   R = 1.2 \times 12^{1/3} \approx 1.2 \times 2.29 = 2.75 \, \text{fm}.
   $$  
Explain why nuclear density is approximately constant.  
   Mass $ \propto A $, Volume $ \propto A $, so $ \rho = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} $ is independent of $ A $.  

Compare the density of a nucleus to the density of a white dwarf star.  
   Nuclear density ($ 10^{17} \, \text{kg/m}^3 $) is ~$ 10^7 \times $ denser than a white dwarf ($ 10^{10} \, \text{kg/m}^3 $).
