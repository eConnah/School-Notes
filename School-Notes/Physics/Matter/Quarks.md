In the early 1960s, physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig introduced a groundbreaking concept: hadrons (like protons and neutrons) were not indivisible, but actually made of even smaller particles known as quarks.

Experimental support for quarks came to light in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1969, scientists at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre (SLAC) observed that electrons interacting with protons reacted to the presence of smaller, point-like charged particles within protons.

In 1974, researchers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory discovered a new particle, the J/Ïˆ meson, composed of a charm quark and an anti-charm quark. This finding solidified the existence of quarks and unveiled a sixth quark type, joining the up and down quarks previously identified.

Subsequently, scientists unveiled more mesons and baryons made up of strange, top, and bottom quarks. The detection of the top quark in 1995 completed the list of six quarks we have today.

The six distinct types of quarks are differentiated by their mass, electric charge, and other attributes:

|                   | Mass            | Electric Charge | Colour Charge       | Strangeness | Charm | Bottom | Top |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ----- | ------ | --- |
| Bottom Quark (b)  | 4,150-4,210     | $-\frac{1}{3}$  | Red, Green, or Blue | 0           | 0     | -1     | 0   |
| Charm Quark (c)   | 1,250 - 1,300   | $+\frac{2}{3}$  | Red, Green, or Blue | 0           | +1    | 0      | 0   |
| Down Quark (d)    | 5-15            | $-\frac{1}{3}$  | Red, Green, or Blue | 0           | 0     | 0      | 0   |
| Strange Quark (s) | 95-190          | $-\frac{1}{3}$  | Red, Green, or Blue | -1          | 0     | 0      | 0   |
| Top Quark (t)     | 172,650-173,490 | $+\frac{2}{3}$  | Red, Green, or Blue | 0           | 0     | 0      | +1  |
| Up Quark (u)      | 2-8             | $+\frac{2}{3}$  | Red, Green, or Blue | 0           | 0     | 0      | 0   |

Up and down quarks are the most prevalent and serve as the foundation for protons and neutrons. The remaining four quarks are less common and are found in more exotic particles such as mesons and baryons.

The strangeness or flavour of a quark is a quantum number that distinguishes between different types of quarks. It is a fundamental property of quarks, like mass and electric charge. The strangeness of a quark can be either positive, negative, or zero.

The strangeness of quarks is important because it determines how quarks interact with each other and with other particles. For example, strange quarks can only interact with other quarks that have a strangeness of zero or -1. This means that strange quarks can only form certain types of hadrons, such as kaons and hyperons.

The strangeness of a quark is also important because it determines how quarks decay. For example, strange quarks can decay into up or down quarks, but they cannot decay into charm, top, or bottom quarks.
