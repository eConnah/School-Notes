# Particle Accelerators
Particle accelerators speed up charged subatomic particles to very high energies in order to investigate the structure of matter. They function by using electric and magnetic fields to propel and guide particles. 

## Linacs
The first particle accelerator was built in 1928 by Rolf Widerøe. It was a linear particle accelerator[^Linac], it used oscillating electric fields to accelerate potassium and sodium ions. Higher energy linacs were later built in the 1940s and began to be used in nuclear and particle physics research. 

## Cyclotrons
In 1929, Ernest Lawrence invented the circular particle accelerator[^Cyclotron]. Magnetic fields bend the particle beam in a spiral path as the beam repeatedly crosses the gap between two D-shaped electrode halves. Each time the accelerated particles cross the gap, the applied electric field imparts additional energy to them. Successive modern cyclotrons were specifically devised to accelerate protons, alpha particles, or ions.

## Synchrotrons
A synchrotron is a particular type of cyclic particle accelerator where electromagnetic fields are synchronised to accelerate particles, usually electrons, to very high energies. Strong magnetic fields are used to bend their path into a closed loop rather than a spiral. The electron beam circulates through the accelerator thousands of times, gaining more energy with each cycle, before being extracted for experimentation. One key advantage of synchrotrons is the ability to achieve much higher beam energies than standard cyclotrons, including acceleration to levels near the speed of light. The [CERN LHC](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) particle accelerator is the worlds largest implementation of a synchrotron allowing us to discover particles like the Higgs Boson.

# Cloud Chambers
The cloud chamber, invented in 1911 by Charles Thomson Rees Wilson, provides a way to visualise ionising radiation. The chamber is filled with gas supersaturated with vapour. Charged particles from radioactive sources pass through the chamber, leaving a trail of ionised gas molecules behind them as they move. The local decrease in pressure caused by this ionisation allows the vapour to condense into cloud droplets – creating a trail of tiny droplets that reveals the path of the ionising particle. 

Early chambers used alcohol vapour, while later chambers utilised liquefied noble gases like argon or neon, allowing larger chambers to be constructed. Photographic methods record the trails left behind, which can then be studied to determine properties like the charge and momentum of the particles. Below is a picture of a cloud chamber used to prove the existence of the positron[^Positron].

# Geiger Counters 
The Geiger counter detects radiation through the ionisation produced in a tube filled with an inert gas. The detecting component consists of a Geiger-Müller tube filled with argon, neon, helium or a similar gas, with an end cap electrode. A high voltage power supply maintains several hundred volts across the tube.

When ionising radiation passes through and interacts with the gas it causes a pulse of current to pass through the tube. These current pulses are counted and registered by the instrument. Geiger counters equipped with digital displays roughly indicate radiation fields and intensities. More sophisticated instruments are needed to measure radiation precisely.

# Spark Chambers
The spark chamber records images of the wires in a multi-wire chamber after passage of a charged particle. Hundreds of parallel thin metal wires are connected between two plates with a high electric field of roughly $10,000V$ applied between them. The chamber also contains a mixture of gases (often hydrogen, neon, or argon).

When a high energy charged particle passes through, the resulting ionisation trail causes electrons/ions to accelerate rapidly towards/away from the wires, gaining sufficient energy to initiate further ionisation upon collision (an “electron avalanche”). This localised conductivity briefly creates a strong visible spark discharge as current flows through. The discharged wires reveal a snapshot showing the exact path taken by the particle.

# Bubble Chambers 
Developed in 1952 by Donald Glaser, bubble chambers utilise pressurised, superheated liquid (typically liquid hydrogen) to visualise tracks left by charged atomic particles. An external magnet bends the trajectories of charged particles passing through the chamber. The decrease in pressure caused by ionisation enables localised boiling along the particle’s path, leaving a trail of microscopic vapour bubbles.

High speed cameras capture multiple views of particle interactions from varying angles, measurements can then be taken to calculate precise particle masses, relative energy as well as identify it. Though now deprecated, bubble chambers provided accurate information concerning the fundamental properties of particle physics.
