# Background Research
## Fundamental Objective
To calculate the <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Mass Per Unit Length</mark> of a string through a stationary wave using weights to adjust <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tension</mark> and Cathode Ray Oscilloscope to measure <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Frequency</mark>.

## Investigation
Stationary waves, also known as standing waves, are formed when two waves of equal <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Frequency</mark> and amplitude travel in opposite directions and superpose. The interference of the incident and reflected waves produces a wave pattern that appears stationary at fixed positions along the string. Nodes are the fixed points of zero displacement, while antinodes are the fixed points of maximum displacement.

## Equations
$$\lambda = 2L$$
$$f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$$
$$f_{1} = \frac{v}{2L}$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{F_{t}}{\mu}}$$
$$f_{1} = \frac{1}{2L} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{F_{t}}{\mu}}$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ is wavelength.
- L is the length of the string.
- $f_{1}$ is the fundamental <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Frequency</mark>.
- v is wave speed.
- $F_{t}$ is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tension</mark>.
- $\mu$ is the <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Mass Per Unit Length</mark>.

## Hypothesis
The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Frequency</mark> of the stationary wave will be directly proportional to the square root of the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tension</mark> in the string.

# Practical
## Equipment 
- String attached to two points.

## Hazards
- Securely clamp string and generator.
- Ensure no trip hazards.
## Variables
Independent: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tension</mark>, $(N)$
Dependent: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Frequency</mark>, $(Hz)$
Controlled: Length of string, Amplitude, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Mass Per Unit Length</mark>

## Method
1. Set up the experiment with a piece of string, a vibration generator, a pulley, slotted masses, a signal generator, a cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO), and a ruler.
2. Choose a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tension</mark> to start with, and adjust the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Frequency</mark> of the generator until the $2_{nd}$ harmonic appears on the string. This is since the node in the centre is better defined than the antinode's of the $1_{st}$ harmonic.
3. Measure the time period of the wave using the CRO. The time period is the time it takes for one cycle of the wave to pass a point (make only 1 or 2 waves appear for better precision).
4. Calculate the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Frequency</mark> of the wave by taking the reciprocal of double the time period. $f = (2T)^{-1}$
5. Calculate the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tension</mark> in the string by multiplying the mass of the slotted mass by the acceleration due to gravity. $F_{t} = mg$
6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 for different <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tension</mark>s.

# Hand-Drawn Graph
A graph plotted with $(2Lf)^{2}$ on the x-axis and $F_{t}$ in newtons on the y-axis using this collected data. The gradient of this graph gives <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Mass Per Unit Length</mark> ($\mu$) as its value. Based on this graph, we obtained a value of $0.661 \times 10^{-3} kgm^{-1}$. This is about $36.7\%$ off the true value of $1.043 \times 10^{-3} kgm^{-1}$.

The error bars provided a gradient of worst fit at about $0.734 \times 10^{-3} kgm^{-1}$ giving the gradient of the graph an uncertainty of $11.1\%$.

# Evaluation
The discrepancy between the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">true value</mark> and our <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">measured value</mark> for <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Mass Per Unit Length</mark> can be attributed to these potential sources of error:
- Inaccurate <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Frequency</mark> measurements using the oscilloscope 
- Friction in pulley system affecting <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tension</mark>
- Inconsistent <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tension</mark> due to slack/sagging of string
- Possible systematic errors in function generator and oscilloscope

Using electronic timers and sensors could improve <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Frequency</mark> and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tension</mark> measurements. Lubricating the pulley and ensuring a taut string would reduce more uncertainties, and taking many repeat trials and averaging results could reduce random errors.

Overall this experiment yielded an answer close to the true value of $\mu$ but having a difference of $36.7\%$ is quite large. If it is ever to be repeated using more <mark class="hltr-red">precise</mark> equipment that rely less on human measurements could provide a more <mark class="hltr-orange">accurate</mark> answer.
