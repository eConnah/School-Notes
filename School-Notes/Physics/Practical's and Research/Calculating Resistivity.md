An experiment to determine the resistivity of a wire by measuring its resistance and dimensions.

# Materials:
1. Wire of known material (Constantan)
2. Meter ruler
3. Micrometer
4. Power supply
5. Ammeter
6. Voltmeter
7. Crocodile clips
8. Switch

# Theory:
The resistivity ($\rho$) of a material is a property that explains its ability to resist the flow of electric current. It is determined by the material's characteristics and is a constant at a specific temperature. The relationship between resistance (R), resistivity ($\rho$), length (L), and cross-sectional area (A) of a wire is given by the formula:
$$R = \rho LA^{-1}$$
Rearranging the equation to solve for resistivity:
$$\rho = RAL^{-1}$$

# Variables:
Independent - Length of Wire
Dependent - Resistance
Controlled - Voltage, Material

# Method:
1. Setup: Set up the circuit as shown in the diagram, with the wire connected to a power supply, ammeter, and voltmeter. The wire should be straight and taut. ![[Resistivity.png]]
2. **Measurement of Length and Diameter:** Measure the length (L) of the wire using a meter ruler. Measure the diameter (D) of the wire at several points using a micrometer. Calculate the average diameter.
3. **Resistance Measurement:** Connect the circuit to the power supply and set a low voltage. Record the current (I) and voltage (V) values. Repeat the process for different lengths of wire, ensuring a range of readings.
4. **Data Analysis:** For each set of values entered in the table, calculate the resistance using $R = VI^{-1}$.

# Graph
A graph plotted with $L$ in meters on the x-axis and $(R \cdot A)$ in $\ohm m^{2}$ on the y-axis using the data. The <mark class="hltr-blue">gradient</mark> of this graph gives resistivity $(\rho)$ as its value. Based on this graph, we obtained a value of $4.99 \cdot 10^{-7} ms^{-2}$. This is about $0.248\%$ off the <mark class="hltr-green">true value</mark> of $5.00 \cdot 10^{-7} ms^{-2}$.

# Evaluation:
The small discrepancy between the <mark class="hltr-green">true value</mark> and our <mark class="hltr-yellow">measured value</mark> could be due to some minor errors in:
- Diameter measurement - using a micrometer has some uncertainty. Taking multiple measurements and averaging reduces this.
- Length measurement - a meter ruler has 1 mm resolution, so length readings are accurate to $\pm1 mm$.
- Current and voltage measurements - the ammeter and voltmeter have a certain percentage error. Taking multiple readings helps minimise this.
- Resistance calculation - using R = V/I means any uncertainty in V and I totals to R. Averaging multiple trials will help improve precision.

However the very small percentage difference of $0.248\%$ between the <mark class="hltr-yellow">measured</mark> and <mark class="hltr-green">true</mark> values indicates that the procedure for measuring resistance, dimensions, and plotting the graph was carried out with a high degree of accuracy and precision. The small uncertainty shows excellent technique in taking measurements, controlling variables, and fitting the data.
