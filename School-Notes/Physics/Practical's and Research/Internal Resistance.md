# Theory
This experiment aims to investigate the relationship between the electromotive force (EMF) of a cell, the internal resistance of the cell, and the potential difference delivered to an external circuit. The EMF $(\varepsilon)$, measured in volts $(V)$, represents the ideal voltage a cell can provide. It's the maximum potential difference it can create between its terminals when no current is flowing. The EMF of a cell cannot be directly measured using a voltmeter due to the cell's internal resistance. However, we can estimate it by measuring the open-circuit voltage (OCV), which is the potential difference across the cell's terminals when there is no active current.

Kirchhoff's Second Law states that the sum of the EMFs around a closed loop in a circuit must be equal to the sum of the potential differences across all components. When a current $(I)$ flows through a cell, some energy is lost within the cell due to its internal resistance $(r)$. This results in the potential difference $(V)$ delivered to the external circuit being less than the EMF $(\varepsilon)$. The difference between these two values, $(\varepsilon - V)$, is often referred to as lost volts.

# Equations
To determine the internal resistance and EMF of a cell we can rearrange Kirchhoff's Second Law to plot on a graph:
$$\varepsilon = V + Ir$$
$$V = -rI + \varepsilon$$
$$(y=mx+c)$$
This equation gives us a straight line with $-r$ as the gradient and $\varepsilon$ as the y-intercept.
