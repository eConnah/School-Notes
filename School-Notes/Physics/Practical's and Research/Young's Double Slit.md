# Theory
To investigate the relationship between the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fringe width</mark> and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">distance</mark> to the screen in Young's double slit experiment, and to determine the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">wavelength</mark> of the laser light.

# Equations
$$w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$
$$ws = \lambda D$$
$$\lambda = \frac{ws}{D}$$
Where:
- $w$ is fringe width, (m)
- $s$ is slit seperation, (m)
- $D$ is distance to board, (m)
- $\lambda$ is wavelength, (m)

# Practical
## Equipment
- Laser  
- Double Slit Slide (known slit separation)
- Tape Measure
- Screen  
- Stand and Clamp
- Vernier Callipers

## Hazards
- Lasers should be Class 2 and have a maximum output of no more than 1 mW
- Do not allow laser beams to shine into anyone’s eyes
- Remove reflective surfaces from the room to ensure no laser light is reflected into anyone’s eyes


## Variables
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Independent</mark> variable: Distance to Screen $(D)$
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Dependent</mark> variable: Fringe Width $(w)$
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Control</mark> variables: Wavelength of Laser $(\lambda)$, Slit Separation $(s)$

## Method
1. Set up the apparatus by fixing the laser and the slits to a retort stand and place the screen so that the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">distance</mark> is $8.5m$ away, measured using the tape measure.
2. Darken the room and turn on the laser.
3. Measure from the middle of the central maxima to the middle of the next fringe using the vernier callipers, to get the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fringe width</mark>.
4. Decrease the distance by $1m$ and repeat the procedure until about $1.5m$.
5. Repeat the experiment twice more and calculate and record the mean <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fringe width</mark> for each distance.

## Results Table

| Distance to Screen $(D)$, $m$ | 1.5  | 2.5  | 3.5  | 4.5  | 5.5  | 6.5  | 7.5  | 8.5  |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Fringe Width $(w)$, $mm$      | 12.3 | 18.0 | 23.3 | 28.0 | 35.1 | 36.2 | 40.9 | 51.1 |

# Graph
The graph should be plotted with $D$ in meters on the x-axis and $ws$ in meters$^{2}$ on the y-axis using this collected data. The <mark class="hltr-blue">gradient</mark> of this graph gives <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">wavelength</mark> ($\lambda$) in meters as its value.

From our graph we obtained a value of $596 nm$, this wavelength of light is more yellow when the laser we were using was red. Our value should have been between $625 nm$ and $740 nm$, if we use the lower boundary for our percentage error we get an error of $4.64 \%$.

# Evaluation
The discrepancy between our measured result and the true value can be attributed to these potential sources of error:
- Alignment issues, if the slits or screen are not precisely perpendicular to the direction of the light source, the interference pattern will be skewed, leading to errors in<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fringe width</mark>calculations.
- Parallax error can occur when taking measurements due to the observer's viewing angle, potentially leading to slight overestimation or underestimation of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fringe width.</mark>

Using high-quality equipment, careful alignment, and proper measurement techniques can help mitigate these sources of error and ensure the accuracy of the observed interference pattern.
