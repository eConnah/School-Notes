# Theory
To find the wavelength of light using a diffraction grating

# Equations
$$\lambda = \frac{d\sin\theta}{n}$$
Where:
- $n$ = the order of the diffraction pattern
- $\lambda$ = the wavelength of the laser light $(m)$
- $d$ = the distance between the slits $(m)$
- $\theta$ = the angle between the normal and the maxima $(\degree)$

# Practical
## Equipment
- Laser
- Diffraction Grating
- Metre Ruler
- White Screen
- Retort Stand
- Vernier Callipers
- Set Square (optional)

## Diagram

## Variables
Independent variable: Distance between maxima $(h)$
Dependent variable: The angle between the normal and each order $(\theta_{n})$
Control variables: Wavelength of laser light $(\lambda)$, slit separation $(d)$, screen distance $(D)$

## Safety
- Lasers should be Class 2 and have a maximum output of no more than 1 mW
- Do not allow laser beams to shine into anyone’s eyes
- Remove reflective surfaces from the room to ensure no laser light is reflected into anyone’s eyes

## Method
1. Place the laser on a retort stand with the diffraction grating in front of it
2. Use a set square to ensure the beam passes through the grating at normal incidence and meets the screen perpendicularly
3. Set the distance D between the grating and the screen to be 1.0 m using a metre ruler
4. Darken the room and turn on the laser
5. Identify the zero-order maximum (the central beam)
6. Measure the distance h to the nearest two first-order maxima (i.e. n = 1, n = 2) using a vernier calliper
7. Calculate the mean of these two values
8. Measure distance h for increasing orders

# Graph
Plot a graph with distance $(m)$ multiplied by $\sin \theta$ on the y-axis $(m)$ and maxima order on the x-axis. This gives the wavelength $(\lambda)$ as the gradient of the graph.
