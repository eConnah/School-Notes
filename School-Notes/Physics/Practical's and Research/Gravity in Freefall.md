# Background Research:
<mark class="hltr-purple">SUVAT</mark> equations are equations that describe the relationship between initial and final velocity, time, acceleration and distance. The main ones for this practical are:
$$s = ut + 0.5at^{2}$$
$$v = u + at$$
Where:
- s is the distance travelled.
- u is the initial velocity.
- v is the final velocity.
- a is the acceleration.
- t is the time.

<mark class="hltr-cyan">Newton's Second Law</mark> helps us understand how objects accelerate in free fall. When an object is in free fall, it experiences acceleration due to gravity alone. Newton's second law tells us that this acceleration is directly proportional to the force of gravity acting on the object and inversely proportional to its mass.
$$F = ma$$
Since in a free fall without air resistance gravity <mark class="hltr-grey">(weight)</mark> is the only force acting on an object.
$$Weight = mg$$
$$mg = ma$$
$$g=a$$
So in the case of free fall all objects will accelerate downwards at the same rate, due to gravity, regardless of their mass.
# Measuring Results Properly:
When measuring the distance travelled by the object, it is important to use a ruler or measuring tape that is accurate to at least one millimetre. When measuring the time, it is important to use a stopwatch that is accurate to at least one hundredth of a second.
# Hypothesis:
Gravity is known to be $9.81 ms^{-2}$ so our result should hopefully be near.
# Prediction:
If we drop an object from a certain height and measure the time it takes to fall, we can calculate the acceleration due to gravity using the following equation:
$$g = \frac{2s}{t^{2}}$$
This equation comes from...
$$s = ut + \frac{at^{2}}{2}$$
$$s = 0 + \frac{at^{2}}{2}$$
$$2s = at^{2}$$
$$a = \frac{2s}{t^{2}}$$
Where:
- s is the distance travelled.
- t is the time.
- a is acceleration (gravity).
# Equipment List:
- Stopwatch with a resolution of 0.01 seconds
- Meter stick with a resolution of 1 millimetre
- Small ball bearing or similar object
- A tall structure for free fall (e.g., a high table or ladder)
# Risk Assessment:
- Hazard: Risk of injury if the ball bearing falls on someone.
- Precaution: Ensure the area beneath the free fall location is clear of people.
- Action: Secure the area and have participants stand clear during the experiment.
# Method:
1. Set up equipment as shown in the diagram.
2. Measure and record the height (h) from which the ball bearing will be dropped.
3. Hold the ball bearing at the initial position and release it. Start the stopwatch simultaneously.
4. Record the time (t) it takes for the ball bearing to fall to the ground.
5. Repeat the experiment multiple times (at least three) to obtain an average value for time.
6. Change the height and repeat.

# Hand-Drawn Graph:
A graph plotted with $time^{2}$ in seconds on the x-axis and $2 \cdot height$ in metres on the y-axis using this collected data. The <mark class="hltr-blue">gradient</mark> of this graph gives acceleration (gravity) as its value. Based on this graph, we obtained a value for gravitational acceleration of $8.67 ms^{-2}$. This is about $11.6\%$ off the true value of $9.81 ms^{-2}$.
# Evaluation
The discrepancy between our <mark class="hltr-pink">measured result</mark> and the <mark class="hltr-green">true value</mark> can be attributed to these potential sources of error:
- Reaction time delays in starting/stopping the stopwatch can affect timing precision.
- Air resistance slowing the ball bearing also causes a minuscule amount of deceleration.
- Friction with the surface on rebound may have shortened fall distances slightly.  

To improve <mark class="hltr-yellow">accuracy</mark>[^Accuracy], an electronic timer with higher <mark class="hltr-orange">precision</mark>[^Precision] could time many more falls automatically. Dropping the bearing in a vacuum chamber would eliminate air resistance effects. Using a laser to precisely trigger and record fall times would substantially increase timing accuracy as well. Additional trials averaging more results would also serve to counteract randomness and approach the true gravitational acceleration.

Overall, this simple experiment yielded a reasonable <mark class="hltr-red">estimation</mark> of $g$, but several small factors contributed slight deviations. Using enhanced equipment and methods could help to enhance precision.
