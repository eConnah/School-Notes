# Theory
To investigate the relationship between the fringe width and distance to the screen in Young's double slit experiment, and to determine the wavelength of the laser light.

# Equipment
- Laser (e.g., He-Ne)
- Double slit slide (known slit separation, s)
- Metre ruler
- Screen (e.g., white paper)
- Stand and clamp for double slit
- Vernier callipers

# Hazards
- Lasers should be Class 2 and have a maximum output of no more than 1 mW
- Do not allow laser beams to shine into anyone’s eyes
- Remove reflective surfaces from the room to ensure no laser light is reflected into anyone’s eyes

# Equations
$$w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$
$$ws = \lambda D$$
$$\lambda = \frac{ws}{D}$$

# Variables
Independent variable: Distance to screen $(D)$
Dependent variable: Fringe width $(w)$
Control variables: Wavelength of laser light $(\lambda)$, slit separation $(s)$

# Method
1. Set up the apparatus by fixing the laser and the slits to a retort stand and place the screen so that $D$ is $0.5 m$, measured using the metre ruler.
2. Darken the room and turn on the laser.
3. Measure from the central fringe across many fringes using the vernier callipers and divide by the number of fringe widths to find the fringe width, $w$.
4. Increase the distance $D$ by $0.1 m$ and repeat the procedure, increasing it by $0.1 m$ each time up to around $1.5 m$.
5. Repeat the experiment twice more and calculate and record the mean fringe width $w$ for each distance $D$.

# Graph
Plot a graph with fringe width $(w)$ multiplied by slit spacing (s) on the y-axis $(ws)$ and distance to screen on the x-axis $(D)$. This gives the wavelength $(\lambda)$ as the gradient of the graph.
