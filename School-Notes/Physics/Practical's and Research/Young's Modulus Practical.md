# Theory
To measure the Young Modulus of a metal in the form of a wire using weights to adjust stress and strain.

# Equations
$$E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}$$
$$E=\frac{F_{t}}{A} \div \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$
$$E=\frac{F_{t} L}{A \Delta L}$$
Where:
- $E$ is young’s modulus, $(Nm^{-2})$
- $\sigma$ is stress, $(Nm^{-2})$
- $\varepsilon$ is strain, (no units)
- $F_{t}$ is tension, $(N)$
- $L$ is length, $(m)$
- $A$ is cross-sectional area, $(m^{2})$

## Hazards
- Wear safety goggles at all times in case the wire snaps
- Make sure a cushion or soft surface is kept directly below the mass hanger, in case it falls off

## Variables
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Independent</mark> variable: Load, (N)
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Dependent</mark> variable: Extension, (m)
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Control</mark> variables: Length, Thickness and Material of wire

## Method
1. Measure the diameter of the wire with a micrometre screw gauge or digital callipers. Take at least 3 readings and find an average.
2. Set up the apparatus so the wire is taut. No masses should be on the mass hanger just yet.
3. Measure the original length of the wire using a metre ruler and mark a reference point with tape preferably near the beginning of the scale.
4. Record initial reading on the ruler of the reference point.
5. Add a 100 g mass onto the mass hanger.
6. Read and record the new reading of the tape marker from the meter ruler.
7. Repeat this method by adding a 100 g mass (at least 5 – 10 times) and record the new scale reading from the metre ruler.

## Results Table

| Mass $(kg)$ | New Length $(m)$ | Extension $(m)$ |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 0.1         |                  |                 |
| 0.2         |                  |                 |
| 0.3         |                  |                 |
| 0.4         |                  |                 |
| 0.5         |                  |                 |
| 0.6         |                  |                 |

# Graph
The graph should be plotted with $F_{t} L$ in $Nm$ on the y-axis and $A \Delta L$ in $m^{3}$ on the x-axis using this collected data. This gradient of this graph will give Young’s Modulus $(E)$ in $Nm^{-2}$ as its value.

# Evaluation 
- If the wire is extended past its elastic limit, it will be permanently deformed to reduce the risk of this, remove the load and check the wire returns to its original length before taking any new readings
- Parallax error from reading the marker on the ruler
