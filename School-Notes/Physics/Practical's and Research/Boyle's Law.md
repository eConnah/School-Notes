# Fundamental Objective
The overall aim of this experiment is to investigate Boyle's Law - the is the effect of pressure on volume at a constant temperature.

# Equations
$$pV = k$$
$$P=\frac{F}{A}$$
$$A = \pi r^{2}$$

Where:
- $p$ is pressure, $(Nm^{-2})$
- V is volume, $(m^{3})$
- F is force, $(N)$
- $A$ is cross-sectional area, $(m^{2})$
- r is radius, $(m)$

# Practical
## Equipment
- Clamp Stand
- Syringe
- Rubber Tubing
- Pinch Clip
- Mass Holder
- Masses
- Vernier Calliper

## Diagram
![[BoylesLaw.avif]]

## Hazards
- Over-pressurising, causing the syringe to explode violently.
- Breaking glass if syringe is glass.
- Masses causing harm.

## Variables
Independent variable - Mass
Dependent variable - Volume
Control variables:
- Temperature
- Cross-sectional area of the syringe

## Method
1. Before setting up the apparatus as shown in the diagram the inside diameter, d of the syringe needs to be measured using a vernier calliper after removing the plunger. Remember to take at least 3 repeat readings and find an average
2. Determine the lowest volume of air visible by pushing the syringe upwards to remove as much air as possible
3. At this lowest volume, the rubber tubing should be fit over the nozzle and clamped with a pinch clip as close to the nozzle as possible (this is to stop air escaping)
4. Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram and ensure the temperature of the room remains constant throughout the experiment
5. Record the volume shown on the syringe before adding the masses and the mass holder
6. Add the 100 g mass holder with a 100 g mass on it to the loop of string at the bottom of the plunger. Wait a few seconds before reading volume to ensure the temperature is kept constant (since work is done against the plunger when the volume increases)
7. Record the value of the new volume from the syringe scale
8. Repeat the experiment by adding two 100 g masses at a time up to 8-10 readings. This is so a significant change in volume can be seen each time
9. Record the mass and volume

## Graph        


The table of results may need to be modified to fit these extra calculations. Here is an example of how this might look:

Once these values are calculated:
    

Plot a graph of p against 1 / V and draw a line of best fit
    
If this plot is a straight line graph, this means that the pressure is proportional to the inverse of the volume, hence confirming Boyle's Law (pV = constant)

Evaluating the Experiment

Systematic Errors:

There may be friction in the syringe which causes a systematic error
    
Use a syringe that has very little friction or lubricate it, so the only force applied is from the masses pulling the syringe downward
        

Random Errors:

The reading of the volume should be taken a few seconds after the mass has been added to the holder
    
Otherwise, a reading will be taken when the temperature is not constant
        
Due to the nature of this experiment setup, it is prone to many random errors
    
Take repeat readings to reduce their effect
        

Safety Considerations

A counterweight or G-clamp must be used to avoid the stand toppling over and causing injury, especially if the surface is not completely flat
