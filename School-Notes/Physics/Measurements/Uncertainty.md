Uncertainty is defined as the degree to which the measured value of a quantity is different from its true value. There are three main types of uncertainty: absolute uncertainty, percentage uncertainty, and fractional uncertainty.

* **Absolute uncertainty** is the smallest possible difference between the measured value and the true value. It is often denoted by the Greek letter delta (δ). For example, if the absolute uncertainty in the measurement of the mass of an object is ±0.1 g, then the true mass of the object could be anywhere between 0.9 g and 1.1 g.
* **Percentage uncertainty** is the absolute uncertainty expressed as a percentage of the measured value. It is calculated by dividing the absolute uncertainty by the measured value and multiplying by 100%. For example, if the absolute uncertainty in the measurement of the mass of an object is 0.1 g and the measured value is 10 g, then the percentage uncertainty is 1%.
* **Fractional uncertainty** is the absolute uncertainty expressed as a fraction of the measured value. It is calculated by dividing the absolute uncertainty by the measured value. For example, if the absolute uncertainty in the measurement of the mass of an object is 0.1 g and the measured value is 10 g, then the fractional uncertainty is 1/100.

To calculate the uncertainty in a calculated value, the uncertainties of the individual measurements must be combined. The following rules apply:

* When adding or subtracting measurements, the <mark class="hltr-red">absolute uncertainties</mark> are added.
* When multiplying or dividing measurements, the <mark class="hltr-blue">percentage uncertainties</mark> are added.
* When raising a measurement to a power, the <mark class="hltr-blue">percentage uncertainty</mark> is multiplied by the power.

To find the absolute uncertainty of a value after multiplication or exponentiation, multiply the percentage uncertainty by the resulting calculated value.

$$\begin{align} a \cdot b &= ab \\ \%Ua + \%Ub &= \%Uab \end{align}$$

Uncertainties are an important part of scientific measurements. They allow us to quantify the degree of accuracy of our measurements and to make informed decisions about the validity of our results.
