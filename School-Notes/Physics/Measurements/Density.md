The following equation is used to calculate density $(\rho)$
$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$
Where:
- $\rho$ is the density (measured in kg/m³ typically, but other units like g/cm³ are also used).
- $m$ is the mass of the object (kg or g).
- $V$ is the volume of the object (m³ or cm³).

Density plays a key role in various phenomena:
- Buoyancy: Denser objects sink in fluids less dense than themselves, while less dense objects float. This principle is used in ships, submarines, and hot air balloons.
- Pressure: Pressure exerted by a fluid depends on its density and depth. This is why water pressure increases as you go deeper underwater.
- Material Identification: Knowing the density of a material can help identify it. For example, gold has a much higher density than wood.

Density and Its Variations:
- Solids and Liquids: These generally have constant densities, meaning their density doesn't change significantly with pressure variations.
- Gases: Gas density is highly dependent on pressure and temperature. As pressure increases or temperature decreases, gas density increases, and vice versa.

Density changes can occur to substances that go through material transitions due to their volume changing with the mass staying constant.
