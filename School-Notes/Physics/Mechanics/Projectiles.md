**Projectile motion**

Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject only to the acceleration due to gravity. It is a two-dimensional motion, meaning that the object's velocity and acceleration can be resolved into horizontal and vertical components.

The horizontal component of the object's velocity is constant throughout its motion, as there is no net force in the horizontal direction. The vertical component of the object's velocity is subject to the acceleration due to gravity, g, and will therefore change over time.

The trajectory of a projectile is a parabola, and the maximum height reached by the projectile will be reached when the vertical component of its velocity is zero. The range of the projectile is the horizontal distance travelled before it hits the ground.

**SUVAT equations**

The SUVAT equations are a set of equations that can be used to describe the motion of an object in one dimension. The equations are as follows:

- $v = u + at$
- $s = ut + \frac{at^{2}}{2}$
- $v^{2} = u^{2} + 2as$
- $s = \frac{u + v}{2t}$
- $s = v - \frac{at^2}{2}$

Where:
- v is the final velocity of the object
- u is the initial velocity of the object
- a is the acceleration of the object
- s is the distance travelled by the object
- t is the time taken for the object to travel the distance s

**Using SUVAT equations to solve projectile motion problems**

To solve projectile motion problems using SUVAT equations, it is important to remember that the motion of the projectile can be split into two independent motions: horizontal and vertical.

The horizontal motion of the projectile is at a constant velocity, so the SUVAT equations that can be used to describe this motion are:

- $s = ut$
- $v = u$

The vertical motion of the projectile is subject to the acceleration due to gravity, so the SUVAT equations that can be used to describe this motion are:

- $v = u + gt$
- $s = ut + \frac{gt^{2}}{2}$
- $v^{2} = u^{2} + 2gs$

Once the horizontal and vertical motions of the projectile have been analysed separately, the results can be combined to find the overall motion of the projectile.

**Example:**

A projectile is launched at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal with an initial velocity of $10ms^{-1}$. Calculate the maximum height reached by the projectile and the range of the projectile.

**Solution:**

To calculate the maximum height reached by the projectile, we can use the vertical SUVAT equation:

$v = u + gt$

When the projectile reaches its maximum height, its vertical velocity will be zero. Therefore, we can set v to zero in the equation and solve for t:

$0 = u + gt$

$t = -u/g$

$t = \frac{-10ms^{-1}}{-9.81 ms^{-2}}$

$t = 1.02s$

Now that we know the time taken for the projectile to reach its maximum height, we can use the vertical SUVAT equation:

$s = ut + \frac{gt^{2}}{2}$

To calculate the maximum height reached by the projectile:
$s = (10 ms^{-1}) \cdot (1.02s) + \frac{(-9.81 ms^{-2})(1.02 s)^{2}}{2}$

$s = 5.1 m$

To calculate the range of the projectile, we can use the horizontal SUVAT equation:

$s = ut$

Since the horizontal velocity of the projectile is constant, the range of the projectile is simply the horizontal distance travelled by the projectile in the time it takes to reach the ground. We can calculate the time it takes for the projectile to reach the ground using the vertical SUVAT equation:

$v = u + gt$

Setting v to zero and solving for t, we get:
$t = \frac{-u}{g}$

$t = \frac{-10ms^{-1}}{-9.81 ms^{-2}}$

$t = 1.02 s$

Therefore, the range of the projectile is:

$s = ut = (10 ms^{-1})(1.02 s) = 10.2 m$
