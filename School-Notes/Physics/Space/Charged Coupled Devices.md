![[Input Output#Digital Cameras]]

As the photons strike the pixels they cause electrons to be released (photoelectric effect). This alters the charge on the pixel which is measured and creates a digital signal. This signal describes where the light hits, it’s brightness/intensity as the charge on each pixel will vary depending on how many photons hit it this is how a digital image is created. The CCD uses a silicon chip.

CCD’s operate over a larger range of wavelengths than just the visible spectrum, and using phosphorous fluorescence as well you can even get incoming UV and X-rays to be detected by the CCD’s.

# Quantum Efficiency
This is a measure of how many of the incident photons are detected by the device. The human eye is only 1% efficient, photographic film is 4% efficient and CCD’s are over 80% efficient. This means that objects need to be viewed for less time to get an image and more faint objects can be photographed when CCD’s are used.
