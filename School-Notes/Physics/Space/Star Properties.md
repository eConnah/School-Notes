Stars can be classified by their power output, the name given to the power output for a star is luminosity. The luminosity of a star is the amount of energy radiated out by a star per second. Meaning luminosity is measured in watts.

The intensity of a star is the power received by an observer per unit area.
$$\text{Intensity} = \frac{\text{Power Received}}{\text{Area}}$$

Apparent Magnitude $(m)$ as a way to quantify the perceived brightness of astronomical objects from Earth. It's not a direct measure of an object's true luminosity, but rather a combination of an object's luminosity and its distance from us.
Absolute magnitude is what the apparent magnitude would be if the same object was 10 parsecs away.
The absolute magnitude and apparent magnitude are linked by the following equation
$$m - M = 5 \log \frac{d}{10}$$
Where:
- $m$ is Apparent Magnitude
- $M$ is Absolute Magnitude
- $d$ is distance, $(pc)$


| Object    | Apparent Magnitude |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| Sun       | -26                |
| Full Moon | -19                |
| Venus     | -4                 |
| Sirius    | -1.5               |
| Vega      | 0                  |
| Altair    | 0.8                |
| Polaris   | 2.0                |

# Astronomical Units
- The parsec $(pc)$ is the most commonly used astronomical unit but it is the most difficult unit to define. One parsec is the distance which causes a parallax angle of 1 arcsecond to be observed. $1 pc = 3.08 \times 10^{16}m$
- 1 Astronomical Unit $(AU)$ is the mean distance of the sun / Earth orbit. $1 AU = 1.50 \times 10^{11}m$
- 1 Light Year $(ly)$ is the distance that light can travel in one year in a vacuum. $1 ly = 9.45 \times 10^{15}m$

# Masses
Any star with a mass of more than 8x our sun is considered a High Mass Star. High mass stars are hotter as the mass squeezes hydrogen harder causing faster fusion. A red dwarf is $\frac{1}{3}$ the mass of our sun, they are the longest lasting type of stars. As main sequence stars get older they get brighter. When a star grows it gives off more energy but the size grows faster leading to a colder star. A low mass star cannot fuse anything more than carbon, ever.

White dwarfs are the end of low mass stars, roughly the size of earth. They don’t generate energy but they do give off energy charging planetary nebulae; gas clouds that came from the previous layers of the star when it was still a red giant. This makes them glow.

Iron is the last element a supermassive star will fuse, this is because it needs energy to fuse instead of creating energy.
