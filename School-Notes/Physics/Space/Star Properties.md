Stars can be classified by their power output, the name given to the power output for a star is luminosity. The luminosity of a star is the amount of energy radiated out by a star per second. Meaning luminosity is measured in watts.

The intensity of a star is the power received by an observer per unit area.
$$\text{Intensity} = \frac{\text{Power Received}}{\text{Area}}$$

Apparent Magnitude $(m)$ as a way to quantify the perceived brightness of astronomical objects from Earth. It's not a direct measure of an object's true luminosity, but rather a combination of an object's luminosity and its distance from us.
The absolute magnitude and apparent magnitude are linked by the following equation
$$m - M = 5 \log \frac{d}{10}$$
Where:
- $m$ is Apparent Magnitude
- $M$ is Absolute Magnitude
- $d$ is distance, $(pc)$


| Object    | Apparent Magnitude |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| Sun       | -26                |
| Full Moon | -19                |
| Venus     | -4                 |
| Sirius    | -1.5               |
| Vega      | 0                  |
| Altair    | 0.8                |
| Polaris   | 2.0                |

The parsec $(pc)$ is the most commonly used astronomical unit but it is the most difficult unit to define. One parsec is the distance which causes a parallax angle of 1 arcsecond to be observed.
