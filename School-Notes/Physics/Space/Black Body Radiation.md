Stars emit Electromagnetic radiation because they are hot. The amount of radiation given off at each wavelength is dependant on the temperature of the star. Stars emit this energy like a black body in other words the curve follows a very good estimate to a hot object that was perfectly black.

$$\lambda_{\text{MAX}}T=2.9 \times 10^{-3}m K$$
Where:
- $\lambda$ is wavelength, $(m)$
- $T$ is temperature, $(K)$

The hotter black body emits more radiation than a cooler one, and its peak wavelength will be a shorter wavelength. It also has a higher total power output. A hotter star may not appear as bright as a cooler one as it may mostly emit radiation that isn’t in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

$$L=\sigma AT^{4}=4 \pi R_{s}^{2}AT^{4}$$
Where:
- $L$ is luminosity, $(W)$
- $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \, Wm^{-2}K^{-4}$
- $A$ is surface area, $(m^{2})$
- $T$ is temperature, $(K)$

We can classify stars using their light spectra as well as their power output. Energy levels in atoms - electrons can only exist in certain energy levels each level is given a number that represents the lowest energy state an electron can occupy.

# Line Absorption Spectra
Stars are approximately black bodies so will emit a continuous spectrum of radiation. However you will get absorption lines when the star’s radiation has passed through a cooler gas. At low temperatures most electrons in the gas atoms will be in their ground states. Photons are absorbed to excite these to higher levels. When the electrons de-excite the same wavelength of light is emitted and radiated in all directions hence reducing the intensity of this wavelength reaching Earth, which is shown by dark lines in the continuous spectrum.

The wavelengths corresponding to the visible part of hydrogens line absorption spectrum are cause by electrons in atomic hydrogen moving between n=2 and higher states. This leads to a series of lines called the Balmer Series. The intensity of Balmer lines can be used to find the temperature of a star.
