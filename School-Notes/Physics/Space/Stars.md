# Star Properties
One property of stars is known as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">luminosity</mark> which is the rate a star releases energy in the form of light. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Intensity</mark> is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">luminosity</mark> of a star per unit area and has the unit $Wm^{-2}$. The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">intensity</mark> of a star follows the inverse square law meaning it’s inversely proportional to the square of the distance. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Intensity</mark> is the effective brightness of an object.

The ​<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">apparent magnitude</mark> $(m)$​ of an object is ​how bright the object appears​ in the sky, this will depend on a star’s <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">luminosity</mark> and distance from the Earth. The ​Hipparcos scale​ is used to classify objects by their magnitude, with the brightest ​stars given an magnitude of ​1​, and the ​faintest visible ​stars being given an magnitude of ​6​. The ​intensity of a magnitude 1 star is 100 greater than a magnitude 6 star​ with the scale being logarithmic.

The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">​absolute magnitude</mark> of an object is what its ​<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">apparent magnitude</mark> would be if it were placed 10 parsecs away from the Earth. The relationship between <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">apparent magnitude</mark> and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">absolute magnitude</mark> can be expressed by the following equation:
$$M=m-5\log{\frac{d}{10}}$$
Where:
- $m$ is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">apparent magnitude</mark>, no unit.
- $M$ is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">absolute magnitude</mark>, no unit.
- $d$ is distance, in $pc$.

# Spectral Classes
Stars are classified into groups called spectral classes. The spectral class of a star depends on the relative strength of certain absorption lines. There are seven main spectral classes that we classify stars into. It has the mnemonic “**O**h **B**e **A** **F**ine **G**irl **K**iss **M**e”.

| Spectral Class | Colour         | Temperature $(k)$ | Absorption Lines          | Balmer Lines      |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| O              | Blue           | 25,000 - 50,000   | $He^{+}, He, H$           | Weak              |
| B              | Blue           | 11,000 - 25,000   | $He, H$                   | Slightly Stronger |
| A              | Blue - White   | 7,500 - 11,000    | $H$ + Metal Ions          | Strongest         |
| F              | White          | 6,000 - 7,500     | Metal Ions                | Weak              |
| G              | Yellow - White | 5,000 - 6,000     | Metal Ions + Atoms        | None              |
| K              | Orange         | 3,500 - 5,000     | Neutral Metal Atoms       | None              |
| M              | Red            | < 3,500           | Neutral Atoms + Molecules | None              |

# HR Diagram
The temperature scale on a HR diagram is ​logarithmic​ – it ​halves​ at every interval. The absolute magnitude scale also goes from positive at the bottom to negative at the top because the brightest stars have negative absolute magnitudes. The ​sun ​is a ​main sequence​ star, its spectral class is ​G​ and its absolute magnitude is ​4.83​.

# Black-Body Radiation
A ​black body radiator​ is a ​perfect emitter and absorber of all possible wavelengths of radiation​. Stars can be approximated as black bodies.

## Stefan’s Law
Stefan’s law ​states that the power output <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">(luminosity)</mark> of a black body radiator is ​directly proportional​ to its ​surface area $(A)$ ​and its​ absolute temperature to the power of 4 $(T^{4})$.​ It can be used to ​compare​ the power output, temperature and size of stars. The equation below relates them.
$$P=\sigma AT^{4}$$
Where:
- P is luminosity, $W$.
- $\sigma$ is ​Stefan’s constant​, $5.67 \times 10^{-8}​ Wm^{-2} ​K^{-​4}$.
- $A$ is surface area, $m^{2}$.
- $T$ is the absolute temperature, $K$.

## Wien’s Displacement Law
​The peak wavelength $(\lambda _{\text{max}})$​ of emitted radiation is ​inversely proportional​ to the ​absolute temperature $(T)​$ of the object. The peak wavelength is the wavelength of light released at maximum intensity.
$$\lambda _{\text{max}}T = 2.9 \times 10^{-3}mK$$
Where the unit $mk$ is ​metres-Kelvin​, not milliKelvin.
Wein’s law shows that the peak wavelength of a black body ​decreases​ as it gets hotter meaning the frequency increases so the energy of the wave increases​ (as expected).
This law can be used to ​estimate ​the temperature of black-body sources.
