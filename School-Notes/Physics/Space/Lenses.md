The angle at which a light ray refracts at is slightly dependant on the wavelength of the light. If light of various colours is refracted through one or more lenses then the different colours form images at slightly different positions. This causes a blurring of the colours. This is known as chromatic aberration.

Using a larger lens or filter can fix chromatic aberration but they reduce the amount of light coming through the lens and hence reduce the quality of the image.

Using parabolic mirrors to focus light gets rid of the problem of chromatic aberrations this is because the angle of reflection is independent of wavelength. 
- Light that travels parallel to the normal will reflect through the principle focus.
- Light that travels along the principal axis reflect straight back along that line.
- Any ray that strikes the principal axis will reflect at the same angle as the angle of incidence.

The Cassegrain Telescope works in a similar way to a newtonian telescope except that there is a convex mirror that straightens out the rays after they have been focused from the primary mirror. Spherical aberrations still can exist in mirrors but large diameter mirrors with large focal lengths and using light only from close to their centres avoids this.

Spherical aberrations occur in both lenses and mirrors and it is because light hitting different sections do not always meet at the principle focus. These cannot be overcome simply with design changes in shape as it varies with the angle of incident light. The effect can be minimised by using oversized lenses/mirrors and closing the aperture to only use the centre when pin sharp images are needed.
