The angle at which a light ray refracts at is slightly dependant on the wavelength of the light. If light of various colours is refracted through one or more lenses then the different colours form images at slightly different positions. This causes a blurring of the colours. This is known as chromatic aberration.

Using a larger lens or filter can fix chromatic aberration but they reduce the amount of light coming through the lens and hence reduce the quality of the image.

Using parabolic mirrors to focus light gets rid of the problem of chromatic aberrations this is because the angle of reflection is independent of wavelength. 
- Light that travels parallel to the normal will reflect through the principle focus.
- Light that travels along the principal axis reflect straight back along that line.
- Any ray that strikes the principal axis will reflect at the same angle as the angle of incidence.

The Cassegrain Telescope works in a similar way to a Newtonian Telescope except that there is a convex mirror that straightens out the rays after they have been focused from the primary mirror. Spherical aberrations still can exist in mirrors but large diameter mirrors with large focal lengths and using light only from close to their centres avoids this.

Spherical aberrations occur in both lenses and mirrors and it is because light hitting different sections do not always meet at the principle focus. These cannot be overcome simply with design changes in shape as it varies with the angle of incident light. The effect can be minimised by using oversized lenses/mirrors and closing the aperture to only use the centre when pin sharp images are needed.

If two objects are close together and far away diffraction patterns overlap and angular seperation is very small. If angular separation is too small multiple objects will only appear as one and cannot be resolved (by lenses).

Resolving power is a measure of how much detail you can see while minimum angular resolution is the smallest angular separation at which the instrument can distinguish points. If the maximum of one, lines up with the minimum of another one then this is the limit of the sources being resolvable. This is the Rayleigh Criterion.
The resolving power needed to resolve two points is given by:
$$\Theta = \frac{x}{y}$$
$$\Theta = \frac{\lambda}{d}$$
Where:
- $x$ is the distance between two objects.
- $y$ is the distance between the objects and the observer.
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength on the incoming em radiation.
- $d$ is the diameter of the lens.
If the resolving power for objects exceeds the telescope then it cannot resolve them.
