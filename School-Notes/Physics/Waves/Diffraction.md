Diffraction refers to the bending of waves around obstacles and openings. It occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or slit that is comparable in size to the wavelength. As the wave passes by the edge of the obstacle, some bending of the wavefronts takes place which results in diffraction. 

For visible light, diffraction effects become prominent when passing through apertures and slits comparable in size to the wavelength of light, which is around 400-700 nm. For example, light from a laser beam spreading out after passing through a narrow slit demonstrates diffraction.

Every point on a wavefront can be considered a source of secondary wavelets. The bending of the wavefronts during diffraction happens due to the interference of these wavelets from different parts of the aperture or slit. Constructive and destructive interference leads to the diffraction pattern observed.

The angular spreading of light from a single slit of width a is given by the diffraction relation:

$$\sin(\theta) = \lambda/a$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle from the centreline and $\lambda$ is the wavelength. This equation specifies the main diffraction peak locations.

When using a narrow slit known as an aperture, the extent of diffraction will depend on the width of the gap compared with the wavelength of the waves. Diffraction is the most prominent when the width of the slit is approximately equal to the wavelength. The features of the single slit diffraction pattern are:
- A central maximum with a high intensity
- Subsidiary maxima equally spaced, successively smaller in intensity and half the width of the central maximum

If the laser were to be replaced by a non-laser source emitting white light:
- The central maximum would be white
- All maxima would be composed of a spectrum
- The shortest wavelength <mark class="hltr-purple">violet</mark>/<mark class="hltr-blue">blue</mark> would appear nearest to the central maximum
- The longest wavelength <mark class="hltr-red">red</mark> would appear furthest from the central maximum
- The fringe spacing would be smaller and the maxima would be wider

## Diffraction Gratings
Diffraction gratings consist of a large number of closely spaced parallel slits or grooves, which act as sources of diffraction and interference patterns. When monochromatic light hits the diffraction grating, it produces a series of bright and dark fringes, known as the diffraction pattern.

The diffraction pattern produced by a grating is governed by the grating equation:
$$n \lambda = d \sin \theta$$
Where:
- n is the order of maxima.
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light.
- d is the distance between slits.
- $\theta$ is the angle to the zero order

The diffraction pattern consists of a central bright fringe and several higher-order bright fringes on either side. The intensity of these fringes decreases with increasing order, and their angular separation depends on the wavelength of the incident light and the grating spacing.
