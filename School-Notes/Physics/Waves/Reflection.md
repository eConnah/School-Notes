Reflection is a key wave phenomenon that occurs when waves hit a surface and bounce off, changing direction. It applies to any type of wave.

When a wave is incident on a surface, the angle it approaches at is known as the angle of incidence $\theta_i$. The wave then bounces off the surface at the angle of reflection $\theta_r$ the angle measured between the reflected ray and the normal to the surface. Importantly, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection as stated in the law of reflection $\theta_i = \theta_r$.

Smooth, polished surfaces like mirrors reflect waves in a regular, coherent manner as the wavefront remains undistorted. However, rough surfaces reflect waves in a diffuse manner as the wave is scattered in many directions off the irregularities.
