Longitudinal waves are a type of wave in which the particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction of energy transfer. This means that the individual particles move back and forth along the direction of the wave, rather than perpendicular to it as in [[Transverse]] waves. Longitudinal waves are also sometimes called compression waves or pressure waves.

Key Characteristics of Longitudinal Waves:
- Oscillation parallel to direction of energy transfer: This is the defining characteristic of longitudinal waves.
- Compressions and rarefactions: Longitudinal waves are characterised by regions of high density (compressions) and low density (rarefactions). These regions alternate along the direction of wave propagation.
- Can travel in solids, liquids, and gases: Longitudinal waves can propagate through various states of matter, unlike [[Transverse]] waves that require a medium with elasticity and inertia.
- Cannot be polarised: The direction of oscillation is always parallel to the direction of energy transfer, eliminating the possibility of polarisation.

Examples of Longitudinal Waves:
- Sound waves: Sound waves are the most common example of longitudinal waves. They are caused by the vibration of air molecules, which creates compressions and rarefactions in the air.
- Shock waves: Shock waves are another example of longitudinal waves. They are formed when an object moves faster than the speed of sound in a particular medium.
- Ultrasonic waves: Ultrasound waves are also longitudinal waves. They are used in medical imaging and other applications.

The main wave parameters for longitudinal waves are similar to those of [[Transverse]] waves:
- Wavelength (λ): The distance between two consecutive compressions or rarefactions.
- Amplitude (A): The maximum displacement of the particles from their equilibrium positions.
- Frequency (f): The number of waves that pass a point per second.
- Wave speed (v): The speed at which the wave propagates through the medium.

The relationship between the wave parameters in longitudinal waves is given by the same equation as for [[Transverse]] waves:
$$v = f\lambda$$
Where $v$ is the wave speed, $f$ is the frequency, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

Longitudinal waves have numerous applications in various fields:
- Sound production and transmission: Sound waves are used in various applications, including music, communication, and navigation.
- Medical imaging: Ultrasound waves are used to create images of the inside of the body without using harmful radiation.
- Industrial applications: Longitudinal waves are used in ultrasonic cleaning, welding, and non-destructive testing.
