# Absorption
Absorption is when some of the signal's energy is absorbed by the material the fibre is made from. This energy loss results in the amplitude of the signal being reduced.

# Dispersion 
There are two types of dispersion which can degrade an optical signal - modal and material dispersion. Both types of dispersion cause pulse broadening, the received signal is broader than the initial signal. Broadened pulses can overlap each other leading to information loss.

## Modal Dispersion
Modal dispersion is caused by light rays entering the optical cable at different angles. This causes them to take different paths down the fibre, with rays taking a path straight down the middle of the fibre arriving quicker than rays taking a long reflected path. Modal dispersion can be reduced by using a single-mode fibre in which light is only allowed to follow a very narrow path.

## Material Dispersion
Material dispersion is caused by the different amounts of reflection experienced by different wavelengths of light. Different wavelengths slow down by different amounts in a material, to fix this monochromatic light can be used. This is light of only one fixed wavelength.
