Transverse waves are a type of wave in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer. This means that the individual particles move up and down, side to side, or in a circular motion, while the wave itself propagates through the medium in a straight line. Transverse waves are also sometimes called wiggle waves.

Key Characteristics of Transverse Waves:
- Oscillation perpendicular to direction of energy transfer: This is the defining characteristic of transverse waves. 
- Wavelength and amplitude: Transverse waves have distinct wavelength and amplitude, represented by the crests and troughs of the wave.
- Can travel in elastic mediums: Transverse waves require a medium with elasticity and inertia to propagate, such as solids and liquids. Gases, being highly compressible, can't support transverse wave propagation.
- Can be polarised: Transverse waves can be polarised, meaning that the direction of oscillation can be confined to a specific plane.

Examples of Transverse Waves:
- Waves on a string: Transverse waves can be easily demonstrated by shaking a long string or slinky.
- Light waves: Light waves are the most familiar example of transverse waves. They are composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which vibrate perpendicular to the direction of the wave.
- Water waves: Water waves are another example of transverse waves. They are caused by the oscillation of water molecules in the surface of a body of water.

The main wave parameters for transverse waves are similar to those of [[Longitudinal]] waves:
- Wavelength (λ): The distance between two consecutive crests or troughs of the wave.
- Amplitude (A): The maximum displacement of the particles from their equilibrium positions.
- Frequency (f): The number of waves that pass a point per second.
- Wave speed (v): The speed at which the wave propagates through the medium. 

The relationship between the wave parameters in transverse waves is given by the same equation as for [[Longitudinal]] waves:
$$v = f\lambda$$
Where $v$ is the wave speed, $f$ is the frequency, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

One of the unique properties of transverse waves is their ability to be polarised. Polarisation refers to the directional alignment of the wave's oscillations. For example, light waves can be polarised to vibrate in only one plane, while transverse waves on a string can only vibrate in the vertical direction.

Polarisation can be achieved by using polarisers, which are materials that allow waves to pass through only when their oscillations align with a specific direction. This property has various applications in optics, such as sunglasses that reduce glare from reflected light and 3D movie glasses that separate the left and right images for each eye.

Transverse waves have a wide range of applications in various fields:
- Telecommunications: Transverse waves are the basis for various communication technologies, including radio waves, microwaves, and optical fibres.
- Metrology: Transverse waves, such as laser beams, are used in precise measurement devices, such as interferometers and laser rangefinders.
- Medical imaging: Ultrasound waves are used to create images of internal organs without using harmful radiation.
- Surface modification: Transverse waves, such as ultrasonic waves, are used to clean, modify, and weld materials.
