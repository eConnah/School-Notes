Refraction is the bending of waves when they travel from one medium to another caused by a change in wave speed. It occurs with all types of waves.

When a wave moves between two mediums, the frequency stays constant but the wavelength changes as the wave's speed changes. It speeds up if entering an optically denser medium and slows down if entering a rarer medium. The extent of bending depends on the indices of refraction of the two mediums. 

As a wave crosses the boundary, the part of the wavefront entering the new medium first gets bent as it slows down. This causes the wavefront to change direction and refract. The angle of incidence $\theta_i$ and angle of refraction $\theta_r$ obey Snell's law which states:
$$\frac {\sin(\theta_i)}{\sin(\theta_r)} = \frac {RIM_2}{RIM_1}$$
Where $RIM_1$ and $RIM_2$ are the refractive indices of the two mediums. This law describes how refraction depends on the refractive indices. To calculate the speed of light in a medium use the following formula:
$$c = \frac {3 \cdot 10^{8}}{RIM}$$
# Critical Angle
The critical angle is the angle of incidence needed for total internal reflection to occur. Total internal reflection can only occur if medium one ($M_1$) is more optically dense than medium two ($M_2$). The equation below calculates the critical angle:
$$\sin(\theta_i) = \frac{RIM_2}{RIM_1}$$
