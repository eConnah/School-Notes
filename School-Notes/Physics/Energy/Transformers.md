Transformers are devices used to change the voltage of an alternating current (AC) supply. They are essential in the transmission and distribution of electrical energy, allowing voltage to be increased (stepped up) or decreased (stepped down) efficiently. Transformers work on the principle of **electromagnetic induction**, where a changing magnetic field in one coil induces a voltage in another coil.

#### **How Transformers Work**
A transformer consists of two coils of wire, known as the **primary coil** and the **secondary coil**, wound around a shared **iron core**. The iron core ensures that almost all the magnetic flux generated by the primary coil passes through the secondary coil. When an alternating current flows through the primary coil, it produces a changing magnetic field in the iron core. This changing magnetic field induces an alternating voltage in the secondary coil. The magnitude of the induced voltage depends on the number of turns in the primary and secondary coils.

#### **Step-Up Transformers**
A **step-up transformer** increases the voltage from the primary coil to the secondary coil. It has more turns on the secondary coil than on the primary coil ($N_s > N_p$). According to the transformer equation:
$$
\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s},
$$
where $V_p$ is the primary voltage, $V_s$ is the secondary voltage, $N_p$ is the number of turns on the primary coil, and $N_s$ is the number of turns on the secondary coil. Since $N_s > N_p$, the secondary voltage $V_s$ is greater than the primary voltage $V_p$. Step-up transformers are used in power stations to increase the voltage of electricity before it is transmitted through power lines. High voltages reduce energy losses during transmission because the current is lower for the same power ($P = VI$).

#### **Step-Down Transformers**
A **step-down transformer** decreases the voltage from the primary coil to the secondary coil. It has fewer turns on the secondary coil than on the primary coil ($N_s < N_p$). Using the same transformer equation:
$$
\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s},
$$
since $N_s < N_p$, the secondary voltage $V_s$ is less than the primary voltage $V_p$. Step-down transformers are used to reduce the voltage of electricity to safer levels for use in homes, businesses, and electronic devices. For example, the voltage from power lines is stepped down to 230 V in the UK for domestic use.

#### **Energy Transfer in Transformers**
In an ideal transformer (100% efficient), the power input to the primary coil equals the power output from the secondary coil:
$$P_p = P_s$$
where $P_p = V_p I_p$ and $P_s = V_s I_s$. This means:
$$V_p I_p = V_s I_s$$
From this, the relationship between currents and turns is:
$$\frac{I_p}{I_s} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}$$
In a step-up transformer, the voltage increases, but the current decreases. Conversely, in a step-down transformer, the voltage decreases, but the current increases.

#### **Real Transformers and Efficiency**
In real transformers, energy losses occur due to:
1. **Resistance of the Coils:**
   - Energy is lost as heat due to the resistance of the wire in the coils ($I^2R$ losses).
1. **Eddy Currents:**
   - Induced currents in the iron core cause heating. Laminating the core reduces this effect.
3. **Hysteresis Losses:**
   - Energy is lost as the magnetic domains in the iron core realign with the changing magnetic field.
4. **Flux Leakage:**
   - Not all magnetic flux links the primary and secondary coils, reducing efficiency.

Despite these losses, modern transformers are highly efficient, with efficiencies often exceeding 95%.

#### **Applications of Transformers**
1. **Power Transmission:**
   - Step-up transformers increase voltage for efficient long-distance transmission, reducing energy loss as heat in the cables. Step-down transformers reduce voltage for safe use in homes and industries.
2. **Electronics:**
   - Transformers are used in power adapters to convert mains voltage to lower voltages for electronic devices.
3. **Isolation:**
   - Transformers provide electrical isolation between circuits for safety.

1. Voltage and turns ratio:
$$\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}$$
2. Power in an ideal transformer:
$$V_p I_p = V_s I_s$$
3. Current and turns ratio:
$$\frac{I_p}{I_s} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}$$
