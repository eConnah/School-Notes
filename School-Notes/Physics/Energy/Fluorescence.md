Fluorescence is a luminescence phenomenon in which atoms or molecules emit light after absorbing energy from [[Electromagnetic Waves]]. It involves excitation of electrons to higher energy levels by photon absorption, followed by relaxation back down to the ground state accompanied by photon emission. 

It happens when a molecule absorbs a photon, causing an electron to become excited from the ground state to a higher energy level. The absorbed photon energy is typically in the [[Electromagnetic Waves|Ultraviolet]] region. The excited electron rapidly decays back to the ground state simultaneously emitting a lower energy photon. The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons leads to a difference in wavelength called the Stokes shift. Some energy is dissipated through molecular collisions and vibrations during the excited state lifetime, accounting for the longer emission wavelength. 

The fluorescence lifetime refers to the average time the electron spends in the excited state before returning to the ground state. It is extremely short typically $1-10$ nanoseconds. The fluorescence spectrum depends on the fluorophore structure and is useful for characterisation and imaging.

Applications of fluorescence are numerous. Fluorescence microscopy utilises fluorescent tags to image cellular components with high sensitivity and resolution. DNA sequencing techniques rely on distinguishable fluorescent labels. Flow cytometry analyzes properties of cells or particles using fluorescence. Other uses include biosensors, forensics, and semiconductor research.
