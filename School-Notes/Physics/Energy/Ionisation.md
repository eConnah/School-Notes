An ion is a charged atom that are created by adding or removing electrons from atoms. Ionisation can be caused by:
- Nuclear radiation
- Heating
- Passing an electric current through a gas

Ionisation energy is the energy required to remove one electron from the ground state of an atom. This is most often expressed in electron volts $eV$. The lowest energy state of an atom is called the ground state. When an atom in the ground state absorbs energy, one of its electrons moves to a shell at a higher energy level leaving the atom in an excited state. Excited atoms want to return to their ground state so they release a photon with a frequency given by:
![[Photon Energy#Energy from Frequency]]
and $E$ is given by the difference in energy states. This takes roughly $1 \cdot 10^{-6} s$.
