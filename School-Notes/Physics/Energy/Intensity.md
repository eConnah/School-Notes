Intensity describes the power carried by waves, such as electromagnetic or sound waves, as they propagate through a medium. Specifically, intensity represents the power transferred per unit area normal to the direction of propagation. For electromagnetic waves like light, the intensity is proportional to the square of the wave's amplitude. This means brighter light with larger amplitude has greater intensity. The standard SI units for intensity are watts per square meter ($Wm^{-2}$).
