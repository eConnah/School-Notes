**Gamma radiation** is a type of electromagnetic radiation with the shortest wavelength and therefore the highest energy. It is emitted by the nuclei of atoms when they undergo radioactive decay. Gamma radiation is also emitted by some astronomical objects, such as neutron stars and black holes.

Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can travel through most materials. It is also very ionising, meaning that it can knock electrons out of atoms. This can damage living cells and cause cancer.

Gamma radiation is used in a variety of applications, including:

- **Medicine:** Gamma radiation is used in cancer therapy to kill cancer cells. It is also used in medical imaging techniques, such as PET scans.
- **Industry:** Gamma radiation is used to sterilise medical equipment and to inspect materials for flaws.
- **Nuclear physics:** Gamma radiation is used to study the structure of the nucleus and to detect new particles.

**Properties of gamma radiation:**

- Gamma radiation is electromagnetic radiation, meaning that it travels at the speed of light and has no mass.
- Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can travel through most materials.
- Gamma radiation is very ionising, meaning that it can knock electrons out of atoms.
- Gamma radiation has a very short wavelength, on the order of 10-12 meters.
- Gamma radiation has a very high energy, on the order of MeV (mega-electron volts).

**Production of gamma radiation:**

Gamma radiation is produced by the nuclei of atoms when they undergo radioactive decay. It occurs when an excited nucleus emits a gamma photon. Gamma decay is a very fast process, and the gamma photon is emitted almost instantly after the nucleus is excited.

**Applications of gamma radiation:**

Gamma radiation is used in a variety of applications, including:

- **Medicine:** Gamma radiation is used in cancer therapy to kill cancer cells. It is also used in medical imaging techniques, such as PET scans.
- **Industry:** Gamma radiation is used to sterilise medical equipment and to inspect materials for flaws.
- **Nuclear physics:** Gamma radiation is used to study the structure of the nucleus and to detect new particles.

**Safety:**

Gamma radiation is very dangerous and can cause serious health problems, including cancer. It is important to take precautions when working with gamma radiation, such as wearing lead shielding and limiting exposure time.
