The ideal gas law is a fundamental equation that describes the relationship between pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of particles or moles in a gas. The equation can be written as , where is the pressure in pascals, is the volume in cubic meters, is the number of moles, is the molar gas constant (), and is the absolute temperature in kelvins. Alternatively, the equation can be expressed as , where is the number of particles and is the Boltzmann constant (). This equation relies on key assumptions about ideal gases: the particles are point masses with no volume, they move randomly and continuously, there are no intermolecular forces between particles, collisions are perfectly elastic, and the time spent in collisions is negligible compared to the time between collisions.

The relationships between the quantities in the ideal gas law are described by three important gas laws. Boyle’s Law states that at constant temperature, pressure is inversely proportional to volume (). Charles’s Law states that at constant pressure, volume is directly proportional to absolute temperature (). The Pressure Law states that at constant volume, pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature (). Together, these laws describe how changes in one property affect the others under specific conditions.

Pressure in a gas arises from the collisions of particles with the walls of the container. This pressure is defined as the force exerted per unit area. On a molecular level, the number of moles in a gas is related to the number of particles by Avogadro’s constant ( particles per mole), with . The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to the absolute temperature, given by the equation , where is the Boltzmann constant. This relationship highlights the microscopic basis of temperature in terms of the motion of particles.

The ideal gas equation can be derived from the kinetic theory of gases, which relates the pressure exerted by particles to their velocity and mass. The equation , where is the mass of a particle and is the mean square speed, connects the macroscopic properties of gases to their microscopic behaviour. Substituting the expressions for kinetic energy and particle velocity leads to the ideal gas law . However, real gases deviate from ideal behaviour at high pressures, where particle volume becomes significant, and at low temperatures, where intermolecular forces affect behaviour. These deviations highlight the limits of the ideal gas approximation.

The ideal gas law has many applications, including determining molecular masses, calculating thermodynamic properties, and linking microscopic properties like kinetic energy to macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature. It provides a bridge between the microscopic world of particles and the macroscopic world of measurable quantities, making it a cornerstone of thermodynamics and kinetic theory in physics.
