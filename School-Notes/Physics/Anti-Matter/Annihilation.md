**Annihilation** is a physical process in which a subatomic particle and its corresponding antiparticle collide and are completely destroyed, producing two or more photons. Annihilation is the opposite of [[Pair Production]], in which a photon transforms into an elementary particle and its antiparticle.

When a particle and its [[Anti-Particles|Anti-Particle]] annihilate, their masses are converted into energy in the form of photons, which are the particles of light. The energy of the photons is equal to the mass of the particles that annihilated, plus the kinetic energy of the particles.

Annihilation can occur between any type of particle and its antiparticle, including electrons and positrons, protons and antiprotons, and neutrons and antineutrons.

**Examples of annihilation**

- When an electron and a positron annihilate, they produce two photons.
- When a proton and an antiproton annihilate, they can produce two or more pions, which are mesons.
- When a neutron and an antineutron annihilate, they can produce a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino.

**Applications of annihilation**

Annihilation is used in a variety of applications, including:

- **Positron emission tomography (PET)**: PET is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses radioactive tracers to produce images of the inside of the body. The tracers decay by emitting positrons, which annihilate with electrons in the body to produce photons. The photons are detected by a PET scanner, which produces images of the distribution of the tracers in the body.
- **Particle accelerators:** Particle accelerators use annihilation to produce high-energy particles. For example, in a linear electron-positron collider, electrons and positrons are accelerated to high energies and then collided, producing photons and other particles.
- **Nuclear fusion:** Nuclear fusion is the process by which two or more atomic nuclei join together to form a heavier nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, and it is the process that powers the sun and other stars. Annihilation can be used to initiate nuclear fusion reactions.
