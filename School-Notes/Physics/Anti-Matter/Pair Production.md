**Pair production** is the creation of a subatomic particle and its antiparticle from a photon. It is the opposite of [[Annihilation]], in which a particle and its [[Anti-Particles|Anti-Particle]] collide and produce photons.

Pair production can only occur when the photon has an energy greater than the total rest energy of the particles being produced. The excess energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the particles.

The most common type of pair production is the production of an electron-positron pair. This can occur when a photon interacts with a nucleus. The nucleus provides the momentum necessary for the conservation of momentum in the reaction.

**Example of pair production**

- When a photon with an energy greater than 1.022 MeV interacts with a nucleus, it can produce an electron-positron pair.

**Applications of pair production**

Pair production is used in a variety of applications, including:

- **Particle accelerators:** Particle accelerators use pair production to produce high-energy particles. For example, in a linear electron-positron collider, photons are produced by the collision of electrons and positrons. The photons can then be used to produce other particles, such as Z bosons and Higgs bosons.
- **Medical imaging:** Pair production is used in some medical imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET). In PET, radioactive tracers are injected into the body. The tracers decay by emitting positrons, which annihilate with electrons in the body to produce photons. The photons are detected by a PET scanner, which produces images of the distribution of the tracers in the body.
- **Astrophysics:** Pair production is thought to play a role in a variety of astrophysical phenomena, such as the production of gamma rays from black holes and the heating of the interstellar medium.
