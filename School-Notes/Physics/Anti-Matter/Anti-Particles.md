**Antiparticles** are subatomic particles that have the same mass, spin, and lifetime as their corresponding particles, but have the opposite electric charge, baryon number, and lepton number. For example, the antiparticle of the electron is the positron, which has the same mass and spin as the electron but has a positive electric charge.

Antiparticles were first predicted by Paul Dirac in 1928, and they were first observed in 1932 by Carl Anderson.

All known particles have antiparticles, including elementary particles, composite particles, and even mesons, which are made up of a quark and an antiquark.

When a particle and its antiparticle collide, they annihilate each other and produce photons. Annihilation is the opposite of pair production, in which a photon transforms into an elementary particle and its antiparticle.

**Examples of antiparticles**

- Electron: positron
- Proton: antiproton
- Neutron: antineutron
- Up quark: anti-up quark
- Down quark: anti-down quark
- Top quark: anti-top quark
- Bottom quark: anti-bottom quark
- Charm quark: anti-charm quark
- Strange quark: anti-strange quark

**Applications of antiparticles**

Antiparticles are used in a variety of applications, including:

- **Positron emission tomography (PET)**: PET is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses radioactive tracers to produce images of the inside of the body. The tracers decay by emitting positrons, which annihilate with electrons in the body to produce photons. The photons are detected by a PET scanner, which produces images of the distribution of the tracers in the body.
- **Particle accelerators:** Particle accelerators use annihilation to produce high-energy particles. For example, in a linear electron-positron collider, electrons and positrons are accelerated to high energies and then collided, producing photons and other particles.
- **Nuclear fusion:** Nuclear fusion is the process by which two or more atomic nuclei join together to form a heavier nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, and it is the process that powers the sun and other stars. Annihilation can be used to initiate nuclear fusion reactions.
