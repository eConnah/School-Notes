Young's modulus, also known as the modulus of elasticity, is a fundamental concept in the study of the mechanical properties of solid materials. It is a measure of the stiffness or resistance of a material to elastic deformation under tensile or compressive stress.

When a material is subjected to a tensile or compressive force, it undergoes deformation, either elongation or compression. The relationship between the applied force and the resulting deformation is governed by Young's modulus, which is defined as the ratio of the tensile or compressive stress to the corresponding tensile or compressive strain within the elastic limit.

The formula for Young's modulus is expressed as:
$$E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}$$

Where:
- [[Tensile Stress]] $(\sigma)$ is the applied force per unit area, measured in pascals (Pa) or newtons per square meter $Nm^{-2}$.
- [[Tensile Strain]] $(\varepsilon)$ is the fractional change in length or dimension, which is unit-less.

Other formulas include:
$$E=\frac{F_{t} L}{A \Delta L}$$
$$E=\frac{kL}{A}$$

Young's modulus has the unit of pascals (Pa) or newtons per square meter $(Nm^{-2})$, which is the same as the unit of stress.
The higher the value of Young's modulus, the stiffer and more resistant the material is to elastic deformation. Materials with a high Young's modulus, such as diamond, require a greater applied force to produce a given amount of deformation, while materials with a lower Young's modulus, like rubber, are more easily deformed.

Young's modulus is an important property in engineering and material science, as it allows for the selection of appropriate materials for various applications based on their stiffness or flexibility requirements. It is also used in the design and analysis of structures, machines, and components to ensure their structural integrity and safety under different loading conditions.

It is important to note that Young's modulus is a material property that depends on the atomic structure and bonding characteristics of the material. It is typically determined through tensile or compressive testing of a sample of the material within its elastic limit.
