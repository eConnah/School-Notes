Tensile stress is a type of mechanical stress that arises when a material is subjected to a pulling or stretching force. It is the stress that results in the elongation or extension of a material along the direction of the applied force.

When a tensile force is applied to a material, it creates an internal resistance within the material's structure. This resistance is due to the attractive forces between the atoms or molecules that make up the material. As the tensile force increases, the interatomic or intermolecular distances within the material also increase, leading to deformation and elongation.

Tensile stress is calculated by dividing the applied tensile force by the cross-sectional area of the material perpendicular to the direction of the force. It is typically expressed in units of pascals (Pa) or newtons per square meter $(Nm^{-2})$.

The formula for tensile stress is given as:
$$\sigma = \frac{F_{t}}{A}$$
Where:
- $F_{t}$ is tension, in N.
- $A$ is cross-sectional area, in $m^{2}$.

The tensile stress experienced by a material is directly proportional to the applied tensile force and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. A larger force or a smaller cross-sectional area will result in higher tensile stress.

Materials have a specific tensile strength, which is the maximum tensile stress they can withstand before failing or breaking. The tensile strength is an important property that determines the suitability of a material for various engineering applications where it may be subjected to tensile loads.

Tensile stress is also related to the concept of [[Tensile Strain]], which is the fractional change in length or elongation of the material under the applied tensile force. The ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain within the elastic limit of the material is known as [[Youngs's Modulus]], a measure of the material's stiffness or resistance to elastic deformation.
