A magnetic field is a region of space in which a magnetic pole will experience a force. A magnetic field is created either by:
- Moving electric charge
- Permanent magnets
Permanent magnets are materials that produce a magnetic field. A stationary charge will not produce a magnetic field. A magnetic field is sometimes referred to as a B-field. A magnetic field is created around a current-carrying wire due to the movement of electrons. Although magnetic fields are invisible, they can be observed by the force that acts on magnetic materials, such as iron
    
The strength of a magnetic field can be described by the density of its flux lines. The magnetic flux density B of a field is defined as the number of magnetic flux lines passing through a region of space per unit area. Magnetic flux density is measured in teslas (T). One tesla, 1 T, is defined as:
- The flux density that causes a force of 1 N on a 1 m wire carrying a current of 1 A at right angles to the flux
The higher the flux density, the stronger the magnetic field i.e. regions where flux lines are closer together. The lower the flux density, the weaker the magnetic field i.e. regions where flux lines are further apart 

## Representing Magnetic Flux
Like with electric fields, field lines, or flux lines, are used to represent. the direction and magnitude of a magnetic field. In a magnetic field, flux lines are always directed from the north pole to the south pole. The simplest representation of magnetic flux lines can be seen around bar magnets

The magnetic flux lines around a bar magnet show the flux density is strongest at the two poles. The key aspects of drawing magnetic field lines are:
- Arrows point out of a north pole and into a south pole
- The direction of the flux lines shows the direction of the force that a free magnetic north pole would experience at that point
- Flux lines are drawn closer together to represent where the field is stronger
- Flux lines are drawn further apart to represent where the field is weaker
- Magnetic flux lines never cross
