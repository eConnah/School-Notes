The strong nuclear force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, and the weak nuclear force. It is the force that holds the nucleus of an atom together.

The strong nuclear force has a very short range, of about 3-4 femtometer's (fm). This means that it can only act between particles that are very close together.
$$1\text{ fm} = 1 \times 10^{-15}\text{ m}$$
The strong nuclear force acts equally between two protons, two neutrons, or a proton and a neutron.

At distances less than about 0.5 fm, the strong nuclear force becomes repulsive. This prevents the nucleus from collapsing.

It must be strong enough to overcome the already strong electrostatic force of repulsion exerted that acts between positively charged protons.

The electrostatic force of repulsion is a force that acts between all like-charged particles. Protons are like-charged particles, so they repel each other. The stronger the electrostatic force of repulsion, the more difficult it is to hold the nucleus of an atom together.

The strong nuclear force is much stronger than the electrostatic force of repulsion. This is why the nucleus of an atom is able to stay together.
