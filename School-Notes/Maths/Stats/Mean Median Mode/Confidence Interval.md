$$\overline{x} \pm \frac{Z \sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
This formula gives the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval specified in the $Z$ score when the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known. Hereâ€™s what each component means:
- $\overline{x}$ is the sample mean, an estimate of the population mean.
- $Z$ is the z-score - inverse normal - corresponding to the desired confidence level.
- $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.
- $\sqrt{n}$ is the square root of the sample size.
