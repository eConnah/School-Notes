To determine the configuration of three planes in 3D space, follow these rules:

---

Unique Intersection (Single Point)  
Condition:  
  The determinant of the coefficient matrix is non-zero.  
  Normal vectors are linearly independent (not coplanar).  
Geometry: All three planes intersect at exactly one point.  
System: Consistent with exactly one solution.

---

Line of Intersection (Sheaf)  
Condition:  
  Determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero.  
  Rank of coefficient matrix = Rank of augmented matrix = 2.  
  Normal vectors are not parallel but lie in the same plane.  
Geometry: Planes intersect along a common line.  
System: Consistent with infinitely many solutions.

---

No Common Intersection (Triangular Prism)  
Condition:  
  Determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero.  
  Rank of coefficient matrix < Rank of augmented matrix.  
  Each pair of planes intersects along a line, but the three lines are parallel and non-coincident.  
Geometry: Forms a triangular prism.  
System: Inconsistent (no solutions).

---

Parallel Planes  
Subcases:  
  All three planes are parallel and distinct:  
    No common intersection (inconsistent).  
  Two planes are parallel and distinct, third intersects them:  
    No common intersection (inconsistent).  
  All three planes are coincident:  
    Infinitely many solutions (consistent).

---

Coincident Planes  
Subcases:  
  Two planes are coincident, third is parallel and distinct:  
    No solution (inconsistent).  
  Two planes are coincident, third intersects them:  
    Infinitely many solutions along a line (consistent).

Key Takeaways  
Determinant â‰  0: Unique solution (planes intersect at a point).  
Determinant = 0:  
  Consistent (Rank(coeff) = Rank(augmented)): Line of intersection.  
  Inconsistent (Rank(coeff) < Rank(augmented)): Triangular prism or parallel planes.  
Parallel/Coincident Planes: Check normals and constants for relationships.

\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{Unique Point:} & \quad \det \neq 0 \\
\textbf{Line Intersection:} & \quad \det = 0 \text{ and consistent} \\
\textbf{No Solution:} & \quad \det = 0 \text{ and inconsistent} \\
\textbf{Coincident/Parallel:} & \quad \text{Check normals and constants}
\end{aligned}
